       "\"The World Health Organization (WHO) was established on 7 April 1948. Realizing the importance of health for successful life all over the world, World Health Day is celebrated on 7 April on the day of the establishment of the World Health Organization (WHO). World Health Day is a globally celebrated Health Awareness Day. It is said that health is life, but in today's busy and stressed life, humans are not able to pay full attention to their health. Human health is being adversely affected due to a hectic lifestyle, work and stress. World Health Day is celebrated every year to create awareness of the importance of health. On this day, a message is given to make people aware of their health and the government is motivated to formulate healthy policies. \\n\\n\\nAim of Celebrating\\nThe World Health Organization celebrates World Health Day on 7 April every year to improve the level of health of people around the world. The idea is that every human being gets good health facilities at an affordable rate. Millions of people around the world are prey to many terrible diseases.

The World Health Assembly sets a specific theme for World Health Day each year. Various activities are organized on World Health Day to make people aware of the specific subject covered that year and the importance of health in general. As a part of the World Health Day celebrations, various events and activities are organized to help people understand how to avoid various health issues and live a healthy life. Demonstrations and speeches are given to honour those fighting against various diseases. The theme for World Health Day 2020 is to support nurses and midwives. T Speeches are given to motivate and encourage the patients and members of their families to know that they are not alone in their fight.

The WHO is governed by its member states which have been elected to form the world's highest health policy-setting body. \\n\\n\\nThe Health Minister of the member states is a part of this body. It was for the first time during the World Health Assembly that it was proposed to dedicate a special day for world health. All member states agreed that it was a good idea and April 7 was declared as World Health Day. The need for World Health Day was felt due to the increasing number of diseases worldwide. Many infectious diseases spread all the time in different parts of the world and lead to epidemics. This causes panic among people. Through the activities organized on World Health Day, people are made aware of various diseases and ways to avoid them.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn today's time, the biggest reason for people not to be healthy is consuming junk food. Many people prefer readymade food and outdoor food because they are tasty and easily available. Junk food is made of many types of chemicals. This is the biggest reason that so many diseases are introduced. If we want to stay healthy, then we should always eat healthy food and live a healthy lifestyle.\\n\\n\\nToday everyone's jobs are such that they need to sit in front of the laptop for hours.

They should be involved in physical activities like walking, running, cycling etc. It is good for our physical and mental health. People these days are so engrossed in their work that they have taken their health as secondary. World Health Day is celebrated to highlight the importance of making our health a priority. We will be able to handle other aspects of our life efficiently only when we are healthy. It has been rightly said that a healthy brain resides in a healthy body.\""
