              " 'subject: . . . . . use hypnosis to make money !\\n \\n hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n\\'t be so many advertisements . but they are n\\'t making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn \\' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n\\'t care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n\\'t go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , \" i lost 15 pounds \" or \" i quit smoking . \" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying \" they \" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n\\'t you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n\\'t even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n\\'t . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n\\'t have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won\\'t hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n\\'t feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: see if this doesn \\' t interest you . . . .\\n \\n read the 1st paragraph ! if you are convinced that this is not for you , then delete it . my bet is that you will be intrigued enough to finish reading it before you make your decision . financial success brochure dear fellow advertiser : my name is tim brody and i make a living selling a recipe for potato cheese pierogies . this is all i do , and i earn in excess of $ 100 , 000 each year . incredible you say ? now , i am revealing my secret to you . incredible , you say ? it is completely legal and , you too , can be well on your way to earning $ 100 , 000 per year by selling your product , plans , recipe or information through the mail . before i reveal my plan to you , let me tell you a little about myself . five years ago , i placed a classified ad in a food magazine to earn a little extra money . my response was 11 orders and 43 \" get rich quick \" schemes . now , please don t laugh , over the next three years i tried all of those \" get rich quick \" schemes . some actually met with success while many met with complete failure . with each try , i learned something new about marketing my product . finally , this plan came together and in the first 3 months , i made over $ 25 , 000 . after i tried it again , i earned $ 35 , 000 and it became clear to me that i was on my way to financial freedom . now please , this story is not merely to brag . i want you to realize the hard work , persistence and expense that went in to making this program a success . it is also my way of teaching others the problems of many marketing plans , and , hopefully , they will be able to avoid many of my own mistakes and expenses . this program is not for everyone . if you are planning to make a million dollars or to compete with your fellow participants , then this plan is not for you . however , if earning $ 100 , 000 a year in a stress-free program interests you , please read on , you are among the sincere people needed to make this program a success . maybe you have participated in some of those \" get rich quick \" programs before . you probably were dissatisfied with your response rate from the classifieds or mailings ? were you expecting to receive additional income but didn t even receive enough responses to pay for the ad or the stamps ? if you are like others , the answer is yes ! please do not give up hope just yet . there is a way to make money and have fun , as well as fine tune your culinary taste . join a network of buyers and sellers with similar goals for no additional costs . the process is called multi - level marketing and it is not illegal . ( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to \" show \" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ? on the bottom of this page , write your name , address and product , as you want it to appear on this mailer . please print clearly . make 3 copies of the following information that includes 1 ) other participants , 2 ) your name , address and product and 3 ) the control number . wrap a $ 10 check , money order or cash inside of each copy and send one to each of the following people with a self-addressed , stamped envelope . keep the original for your tax records ; it is a legitimate business expense . do not cheat by sending out only one payment . only 1 of the 3 has the required information you will need to proceed . within days , you will receive your products , instructions and this mailer with your name listed as one of the three participants . you will then send out 20 of these mailers to others . within a week , you will begin to receive your money , and within 4 weeks you will have earned over $ 25 , 000 ! it s that easy ! join today ! 1 . j . dolbow 2089 waterbury se kentwood , mi 49508 ( sweetish no - names ) 2 . l . shock 7438 sawmill rd . # 458 columbus , oh 43235 ( amy s famous chicken ) 3 . s . butler po box 770074 coral springs , fl 33077-0074 ( delicious potato salad ) your name _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city , state , zip _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ your product _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ control number 187329 * your total cost for this program is $ 40 . 00 ( $ 30 . 00 to members , $ 3 printing , $ 7 stamps ) . there are no other fees . * canadian residents ask that you please remember to use 2 first class stamps when mailing to them . believe me , the extra stamps are worth it . they are some of our best participants ! * if paying by check , please allow 7 additional days to allow the check to clear . important information to ensure that you keep this legal and honest , be sure to file schedule c profit or loss from business with your income tax return . report all income you receive and deduct all business related expenses . these tax deductible business expenses can include vehicle ownership ( in your company s name ) , expenses , travel and entertainment , business equipment , purchases for your business , supplies , telephone , postage , advertising costs , rent , wages ( other than your own ) , legal and professional services , and business taxes . these can be legally deducted if they are related to your business .

when you sell a report to others you will then be in my position - to make all the over-rides and commissions i have just talked about - on those who then sell report # 5599 ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the following questions & answers are designed to answer most of the concerns you may have . this should give you enough information to determine if ofs \\'s offshore special report # 5599 is your tool for making thousands of dollars a week in a home based business . . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ q . do i have to personally sell the report & the other offshore business support services to people who respond to my ads ? a . no ! this is really a two fold question . let \\'s talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a \" no brainer \" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n\\'t - report # 5599 sells itself ! q . how many hours a week will i have to devote to my business ? a . one to sixty hours a week ! here \\'s a question i will answer with a question . . . how much money do you want to make ? common sense says the more ads you run and the more mailings you do the more money you will make ! the statistics show that for every 100 responses you receive from your ads , and you mail this sales letter , you will sell five to ten reports making you $ 250 . 00 to $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . your ad responses will vary depending on the place you advertise and the circulation of the publication . the more ads you run or the more emails you send out the more time you will need to devote to your home based business . q . just how much money will i need to start my home based business ? a . $ 50 . 00 ! yeah i know - you \\' re thinking you will need money for ads and mailing . well - i \\' ve had people start with $ 50 . 00 ( u . s ) and make ten copies of the report and sold them to their associates and friends giving them $ 500 . 00 ( us ) . that gave them enough money to start running ads and to buy stamps . in looking at all the money making opportunities offered in the world today i really do n\\'t think you can get started for any less than $ 50 . 00 and have a better legitimate money-making opportunity than the one offered in report # 5599 ! q . if i have additional questions who will answer them for me ? a . i will or the parent company will ! no package of information , no matter how complete , can possibly answer every question that may come up . i do not want you to lose money seeking out the answers . i want you to succeed ! you will receive a phone number in report # 5599 where you can either reach me or someone from the parent company for any question or help you need ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ here \\'s a valuable bonus for ordering within 5 days . . . . your \\'s absolutely free !

( normally this kind of software is several hundred dollars ) they even give you easy to understand , proven , step by step instructions for success with this program . in fact , they helped me get started and i \\' m so thankful . it \\'s hard to believe that this as simple as it is , but it really is simple . you will even get support from them via email anytime you need it . you won\\'t get this kind of help from other programs of this nature . it makes all the difference in the world . my name is anne bowman . i am 31 - year-old graduate student desperately trying to finish my degree and begin working in my chosen field that is , if i am lucky enough to find a job in the crowded market . like most people in this day and age , it is hard to make ends meet , and being a student does not help the situation at all ( if i ever have to buy one more box of macaroni and cheese i think i would have to scream ) . i returned to school after having worked for several years with little potential for achieving what i had expected out of life . i figured if i returned to school and received my ph . d there would be several opportunities for me out there to achieve my goals . after seeing my fellow graduate students receive their degrees and , depressingly , not find respectable positions in their chosen field i began to think , \" oh no not again ! \" four extra years in school and an extra $ 20 , 000 in student loans on top of the first $ 18 , 000 , what will i do if the same happens to me ? \" i began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in schooling , and decided enough was enough , \" why can\\'t i make real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee of a lucrative return for all of my efforts ! \" i am writing to share my experience with other hopeful students out there , as well as anyone looking for an opportunity to take their financial situation into their own hands . i hope you will consider this opportunity seriously and that this will change your life forever ! . , financially ! ! ! and once you get started it takes so little of your time . in mid october 97 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . i took this as a sign ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , it made perfect sense . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start ( about as much as it costs for a pizza ! ) , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" i have nothing to lose \" . initially i sent 15 , 000 emails , ( without any costs to me ) only a couple of hours of my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the time to fulfil my orders . there is a vast on-line market available to everyone who owns a computer . following the advice of the person from whom i received this letter , i am telling you like it is , and i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! after you receive the reports they should explain everything to you . you may have some general questions , however , and after i send you report # 1 , please feel free to contact me and i will give you any advice you need . in one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by mid november , i had received 40 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that \" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks if you don \\' t send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by the beginning of december , i had received 174 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee . \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" . well , i had 174 orders for report # 2 , 74 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by january 20th , of my emailing of 15 , 000 , i received $ 54 , 000 with more coming in ever day . the great thing about this program is you can begin the process over and over again without any limit on potential income ! i paid off all my student loans , and together with everything i have learned in school , i am now saving in order to open up my own business related to my field as soon as i graduate . please take time to read the attached program . it will change your life forever ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place on the list . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders of report # 1 and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i \\' m sorry , it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . to my fellow graduate students out there , good luck to you and i sympathise . and to all other persons in financial trouble consider this letter a sign and please take advantage of this opportunity . you won \\' t be disappointed ! sincerely , anne bowman the following testimonial was at the bottom of this letter but it was too good to leave down there so i moved it up here . it is exactly how i felt at first and feel now . \" the first week after i started this program was torture . i could n\\'t wait to see if it was really going to work after i mailed out my first batch of letters . i chuckle every day now when i walk out of the post office with my envelopes . this is so easy , i still can\\'t believe it \\'s happening !

for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n\\'t delete this one !

              " 'subject: $ 7 money maker and e - mail service\\n \\n please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully . immediately print it and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it would be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! ! i didn t believe him , so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed his instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just couldn t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying please put me on your mailing list and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other s lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed !

! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * dear friend , the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is paul campo . i am 23 yrs . old and presently a tennis instructor . i graduated 1 1 / 2 years ago from rutgers university with a psychology degree . not wanting to pursue with my major of study , i started interviewing with various companies . i was accepted / rejected at many different places , mainly insurance and storkbroking companies . every place basically said the same thing . . . . . you will have to work 60-80 hours a week intially with little pay and to write down every person that i know so that i could make them possible future clients . in no way am i a lazy person , however , i am very motivated when i believe in what i am doing . i had no interest in these careers . what would be ideal for me is to delay my career for a little while so that i could pursue my own goals and dreams i had set for myself for as long as i can remember . i want to travel around the would and play some smaller professional tennis tournaments . the one problem with this is . . . . . . . . . . . . . money ! . . . . . . . . . . to make a long story short , because of this program , this year , will be going to austrailia , california , florida and missouri for a mouth a piece to play the tennis ciruit . i figure this will all cost me about $ 10-12000 which is easily affordable for me now . because i took a $ 20 \" risk \" , i now have a chance to pursue my dreams . i \\' m happy as a clam . i received this program via e-mail . all of the programs i had received in the past , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were ethier too diffcult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked out or not . even though i was still skeptical , thinging this to be one of the many scam multi-level \" opportunities \" , i figured $ 20 won\\'t break me and i can throwthis little amount away for that slim chance of making lots of money . but , wait a second . i believe i am an intelligent person and if someone like myself would go for this \" scam \" , i think many people would think the same way i do . even if it did \\' t work out , i figured that i would at least get my money back . but like i was saying , in september of 1997 , i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off of a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . after detrerminging that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" initially i sent 10 , 000 e-mails . the great thing about e-mail is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program . i am telling you like it is . i hope it does n\\'t turn you off but i promised myself i would not rip anyone off . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by october 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarntee in the program you will see that \" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , if you don \\' t send outmore programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20to 90 days was done . by november 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee . \" you must receive 100 ormore orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" . well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i need . so i sat back and relax . by january19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 people , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in everyday . please take time to read the attached program . it will change your life forever !

for a while , it got so overloaded that i had to start pickingup my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i woundered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of cause , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . 11 month passed then it came . . . . i did \\' t delete this one !

! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the \" internet \" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your \\'s , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it \\'s own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that \\'s what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won\\'t get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : angel ann enterprises p . o . box 668292 charlotte , n . c . 28266-8292 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" order report # 2 from : m . l . m . 3069 alamo dr . suite 178 vacaville , ca . 95687-6344 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : c . e . e . p . o . box 5145 framingham , ma 01701-5145 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : m . j . k . p . o . box 30821 seattle , wa 98103-0821 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say \" no \" than \" yes \" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it \\'s simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !

) , you will make at least as much money as i am . you do n\\'t need to be a whiz at the computer , but i \\' ll bet you already are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you \\' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you \\' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you !

most people get 100 \\'s of participants ! think about it ! your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists . some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade ! about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! note : if you need help with starting a business , registering a business name , how income tax is handled , etc . , contact your local office of the small business administration ( a federal agency ) for free help and answers to questions . also , the internal revenue service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium - size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n\\'t delete this one ! . . . i made more than $ 41 , 000 on the first try ! ! d . wilburn , muncie , in this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

              " 'subject: 16 - m clean e - mail addresses\\n \\n 16 million clean e - mail addresses we took a total of over 92 million e-mail addresses from many of the touted cd \\'s that are out there ( bought them all - some were $ 300 + ) ! we added the millions we had in storage to those . when we combined them all , we had in excess of 100 + million addresses in one huge file . we then ran a super \" sort / de-dupe \" program against this huge list . it cut the file down to less than 25 million ! ! can you believe that ! ? it seems that most people that are selling cd \\'s are duping the public by putting numerous files of addresses in the cd over and over . this created many duplicate addresses . they also had many \" program generated \" e-mail addresses like compuserve , mci , anon \\'s , etc . . . this causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables , and for those that use stealth programs , clogs up servers quickly with trash . etc . . . we then ran a program that contained 150 + keywords to remove addresses with vulgarity , profanity , sex-related names , postmaster , webmaster , flamer , abuse , spam , etc . . . also we eliminated all . edu , . mil . , org . , gov . , etc . . . after that list was run against the remaining list , it reduced it down to near 16 million addresses ! so , you see , our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all others that are out there on cd . using ours will be like using the 100 + million that we started with , but a lot less money and a lot less time ! we also purchased cyber promo \\'s ( $ 995 . 00 ) cd . we received it just prior to finishing production work on the new cd . we had our people take a random sample of 300 , 000 addresses from the touted 2 . 9 million that they advertised . we used a program that allows us to take a random sample of addresses from any list . we were able to have the program take every 9th address , thus giving us a 300 , 000 list of cyber \\'s e-mail addresses from top to bottom . we did not clean these , but we did create 3 separate files named cyber1 . txt , cyber2 . txt , and cyber3 . txt of 100 , 000 addresses each . this will give all people that use the list an opportunity to send mail to the list before deciding if their cd is all it \\'s hyped up to be . we also included a 2 + million \" remove / flamer \" file broke into separate files for ease of extracting and adding to your own database of removes . \" you can buy from the rest or you can buy from the best . here \\'s what you get when you order today : * 16 million e - mail addresses * one line in simple text format * all on cd-rom * files are in lots of 100 , 000 ( no codes to open files ) * all files are separated by domain name for your convenience ! * plus you receive a tremendous remove list ! * plus a sampling of cyberpromo \\'s hot list now only $ 149 . 00 ! this price is effective for the next seven days , thereafter the price will be $ 199 . 00 so order now ! all lists are completely free of any duplicates . we also on a continual basis , add new names and remove undeliverables and remove requests . the result is the cleanest e - mail addresses available anywhere to use over and over again . all for a fraction of the cost that other companies charge . typical rates for acquiring e-mail lists are from \" information highway \" robbery ! do n\\'t even hesitate on this one or you will miss out on the most effective way to market anywhere . . . period ! http : / / www . gaura . com / software / sys . htm http : / / www . gaura . com / software to order : to order , simple print out the ez order form below and fax it to our office today . we accept visa or mastercard . or checks by fax fax completed form to : ( 425 ) 379-9722 _ _ _ _ _ e - mail pro . . . . . $ 350 . 00 _ _ _ _ stealth mass mailer . . . $ 395 . 00 _ _ _ _ 16 million clean e - mail addresses on cd-rom . . . . $ 149 . 00 _ _ _ _ check deposit system . . . . . $ 99 . 00 _ _ _ _ submit spider standard version . . . . $ 49 . 95 _ _ _ _ submit spider professional version . . . . $ 99 . 90 _ _ _ _ send software on cd-rom . . . . $ 10 . 00 name : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ address : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ city : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ state : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ country : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ country code or zip code : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ phone : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ fax : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ e - mail : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ type of credit card : _ _ _ _ visa _ _ _ _ mastercard account number : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ expiration date : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ name on card : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total amount : $ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i understand that all sales are final . signature : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ date : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ check by fax : if you would like to fax a check , paste your check below and fax it to ( 425 ) 379-9722 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * please paste your check here and fax it to us at : ( 425 ) 379-9722 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * if you fax a check , there is no need for you to send the original check . we will draft up a new check , with the exact information from your original check . all checks will be held for bank clearance .\\n',\n",

              " \"subject: how 's it going ?\\n \\n hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il\\n\",\n",

money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n\\'t mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place !

              " 'subject: help make the world a better place !\\n \\n dear investor , it \\'s quite obvious we \\' re more powerful in numbers than alone , we can stamp out problems we are faced with day in day out but we make no attempt and if any very little to help irradicate a . i . d . s , famin , the homeless , cancer , child abuse , victims of rape and incest , violence and corruption world wide and do n\\'t forget the environment ( it \\'s a total disaster ) . panamanian offshore banks require as little as $ 1 000 000 . 00 usd in paid in capital to qualify for bank registration . your $ 1 000 . 00 usd investment or more can lead you to an unlimited return . here \\'s some mathematical logistics you take 1000 people together each investing $ 1 000 . 00 usd that makes $ 1 000 000 . 00 usd . we go to panama and register for public listing so all our shareholders can each get 1000 shares each at $ 1 . 00 per share , if all goes well and the securities commission accepts the public listing , we go to step 2 . step 2 . we go to the banking commission and apply for a bank license and upon approval , you \\' ve got your bank owned by 1000 shareholders each holding 1000 shares and can be traded freely and we can apply for a listing on the panamanian stock exchange or any other exchange therafter . let \\'s look at the example below to see how power can be in numbers . the minimal interest paid out for example sake is 12 % anually on $ 1 000 000 . 00 that gives a return of is $ 120 000 . 00 usd . now let \\'s go back to reality if you take $ 1 000 . 00 usd and if your lucky your bank will give you at most a 4 % annual interest rate , that gives you a return of $ 40 . 00 usd . now let \\'s recap , we have 1000 shareholders who invested $ 1 000 . 00 usd each and at the end of a year each shareholders shares have made a substantial return , the exact return for this example is the return on $ 1 000 000 . 00 usd at 12 % annual interest which is $ 120 000 . 00 usd divided by 1000 shareholders = $ 120 . 00 and each of your shares has just incresed by 0 . 12 , $ 120 . 00 divided by 1000 shares = 0 . 12 cents . you \\' ve gained 3 times the return compared to the return your bank would have given you after a year . now this is a very bad example because banks deal with daily currency trades , bankers acceptances , treasury bills , government bonds , gics , stocks , mutual funds , credit and debit / check cards , loans , lines of credit , mortgages and daily transaction fees . but the example above gives you a clear picture that alone you do not have the potential that a mere 1000 people have and with a group you see that your profit potential is much greater because your total capital is much greater and gives you more opportunities and greater flexibility . with banks making record profits of $ 800 000 000 - $ 1 . 5 billion and over a year and with unjustified service charges . we would like to present a new way of battling this service charge frenzy and to contribute back to the community by helping any one of our list of charitable organisations or one of your choice . below is a brief description of our investment objective . our bank will concentrate on the usage of the internet to reduce overhead as well as have the upmost personal touch for commercial , personal and private banking . our sevice charges , which will be few , will be unbeatable . you do n\\'t have to maintain a fixed minimum balance , no costly wire transfer fees . no balance inquiry atm fees and no withdrawal fees . check processing fees will be low as well as many other fees , if any . we also will select a group of charities in which 5 -

! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the \" internet \" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and obtaining e-mail lists . instructions : we at erris mail order marketing businesses , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % everytime . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20-90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your \\'s , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it \\'s own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that \\'s what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won\\'t get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say \" no \" than \" yes \" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it \\'s simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: profit on technology !\\n \\n ( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , \" trillion dollar emerging market \" in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here \\'s the trillion dollar trend in american business that i \\' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of \" bundled services \" . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this \" bundled services \" market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are \" bundled services \" such a big deal ? let \\'s add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , \" bundled services \" are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n\\'t know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that \\'s why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that \\'s why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here \\'s my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a \" free package of services \" designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that \" word of mouth \" is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates & friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is \" income replacement \" and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it \" internetworking \" . the reason we call it \" internetworking \" is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let \\'s say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it \\'s a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you \\' re too busy , that \\'s exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing\\n',\n",

( yes , you can do that and make it work for you too ) the key is i made it work . i was fairly successful until the \" nightmare on pleasant st . \" as my friends and i call it . . . i lost most of my money in that one bad deal and i was no longer financially secure and i relied heavily on my income from my former job . as you \\' ve already heard , i lost that too and i started to look for other things i could make money to help me get back on my feet . so , i started to read all of the junk that people have mailed to me . let me tell you , i can\\'t believe some of the things out there . . . what a waste of time . until i saw this . hold on . i know you are ( like i was ) ready to stop reading right here . i implore you not to . i ( like you ) am not some non-educated fool . i have made much money for myself in real estate , which is not an easy business . i am a rather competent business man . at least finish reading this until the end . * * better still : print this letter and read it in comfort over , and over here is what i saw . . . * i only needed $ 20 extra dollars to try this * this is making money for people who at least tried a little , so why not me too ? in desparation , i sent the four 5 dollar bills and got the reports . as i always have , i made this work for me too . i took much time and effort to learn about e-mail ( which is a great and free tool ! ! ) and how to send lots of it . now , 19 days after my first mailing of this , i have received roughly 8 , 450 responses . ( trust me , when my fiance ` saw 8 , 450 5 dollar bills on the kitchen table , she no longer laughed at me for trying this ) i wrote a report of my own showing step by step how to do the same which i will give to you for free as a helping hand so we can all continue this success . i will show you every step of cutting , pasting , editing this letter to include your name and address , etc . here is my special offer to help you . . . . as long as my address , basquiat at the evanston po box is on the list below i will send the step-by - step instructions and 100 , 000 e-mail addresses to anyone who orders any report from me . it took some time and expense to put this list together so all i ask is that you add another $ 5 for handling the addresses . the instructions for e _ mailing are free . they will come to you in a . txt format ( which i will teach you how to use in the instructions i \\' ve put together ) and less than 2 % will be duplicates . you will get the list of addresses with your report . the first 160 people who order a report from me will receive a different set of addresses . this is my gift to you to help you get started . . . . i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money !

* * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! note : if you need help with starting a business , registering a business name , how income tax is handled , etc . , contact your local office of the small business administration ( a federal agency ) for free help and answers to questions . also , the internal revenue service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium - size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi i had received this program before . i deleted it , but later i wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so i had to wait until i was e-mailed another program . . . 11 months passed then it came . . . i did n\\'t delete this one !

              " 'subject: dated material\\n \\n please follow the instructions of this letter very carefully , immediately print and read twice . greetings hopefully my name is still on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is the same as the letter in front of you now . he asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal . i told him that i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off-the - wall idea to make money . a week later i met again with my client to discuss the issue . i told him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100 % legal . my client asked me to alter the letter to make it 100 % legal . i advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will be all right . i was curious about the letter , so he told me how it works . i thought it was a long shot , so i decided against participating . before my client left , i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later he called to tell me that he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! ! i did n\\'t believe him so he asked me to try the plan and see for myself . i thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose . i followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters . sure enough the money started coming in ! it came slowly at first , but after three weeks i was getting more than i could open in a day . after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totaled $ 868 , 439 . 00 . i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i told myself if things worked out i would retire from practice and play golf . i decided to try the letter again , but this time i sent out 500 letters out . well , three months after that i had totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 . 00 ! i just could n\\'t believe it . i met my old client for lunch to find out how this exactly works . he told me that there were a few similar letters going around . what made this one different is the fact that there are seven names on the letter , not five like most others . that fact alone resulted in more returns . the other factor was the advice i gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal , since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal . i bet now you are curious about what little changes i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to be legal , you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar . i told him that anyone sending a dollar out must receive something in return . so when you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list , you must include a slip of paper saying \" please put me on your mailing list \" and include your name , mailing address and e-mail address ( your phone # is optional ) . this is the key to the program ! the item you will receive for your dollar you send to the seven names below , is this letter and the right to earn thousands . we will be working together to improve each other \\'s lives ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in less than three months you will receive over $ 800 , 000 . 00 guaranteed ! ! ! ! a ) immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the seven people listed below . wrap the dollar in a note ( type or handwritten ) saying \" please add me to your mailing list \" and include your name , mailing address , and e-mail address . your phone number is optional . 1 - jal 8401 e . 60th st . # 2811 tulsa , ok 74145-5075 2 - lbm enterprises 167 hamilton st . oceanside , ca 92054 3 - s + k industries 641a puller pl san clemente , ca 92672 4 - smooth enterprises 205-38 abeyta ct , oceanside , ca 92054 5 - d&k cybermart 2281 annadale way , chula vista ca 91915 6 - arawak , 2442 n . main st . , suite 185 , gainesville , fl 32609 7 - mike m , p . o . box 89009 cp elysee , laval , quebec , h7w 5k1 b ) remove the name next to # 1 at the top of the list and move the rest of the names up on position . then place your name in the # 7 spot . this is best done by saving this to a file and enter in your information on line # 7 . be very careful when you type the addresses and proof read them . c ) when you have completed the above instructions you have options of mailing your new letter in two ways 1 ) through us postal service or 2 ) through e-mail . this letter has been proven perfectly legal for both ways as long as you follow the above instructions , because you \\' re purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list . to mail this out over the internet , you could browse through areas and find people to send this to all the time . all you have to do is cut and paste e-mail addresses wherever you are on the internet . remember , it does n\\'t cost anything to mail on the internet . or you can use a mass e-mail network to mail it out in large volumes for you . we highly recommend this one . they always e-mail more than the amount you purchase and their addresses are fresh . e - mail this letter to them with your name and address in position # 7 above . bulk email is highly recommended for ease and efficiency . newsgroups tend to be very unreliable . just do a search on the web for bulk email . * * you will want to e-mail this to as many people as you can . this will bring you big payoffs . this company has been most effective for this program . * * * keep in mind that there is no limit to the amount of names you could send out . the more names you send the more money you will make . we strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family and friends and relatives as well . * * * this is a service and is 100 % legal ! ! ! ( refer to title 18 , section 1302 & 1342 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws ) assume for example you get a 7 . 5 % return rate , which is very conservative . my first attempt was about 9 . 5 % and my second time was over 11 % 1 ) when you mail out 200 letters , 15 people will send you $ 1 . 00 2 ) those 15 people mail out 200 letters and 225 people send you $ 1 . 00 3 ) those 225 people mail out 200 letters and 3 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 4 ) those 3 , 375 people mail out 200 letters and 50 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 5 ) those 50 , 625 people mail out 200 letters and 759 , 375 people send you $ 1 . 00 6 ) those 759 , 375 people mail out 200 letter and 11 , 390 , 625 people send you $ 1 . 00 at this point your name drops off the list . think about it . with only the first six levels you have received over $ 813 , 615 . 00 ! it works every time , but how well depends on how many letters you send out . in the example above you mailed out 200 letters , if you mailed out 500 letters , you would have received over $ 2 , 006 , 917 . 00 check the math yourself , i want you to , but i guarantee it is correct ! with this kind of return , you \\' ve got to try it . try it once and you will do it again - guaranteed ! just make sure you send a dollar to each of the seven names on the list with a note to be added to their mailing list . together we will all prosper ! ! ! ps you \\' ve read this far , so let me ask you one simple question . q - what have you got to lose a - only $ 7 . 00 what you can gain is an income , like the example in the letter . very small risk . very small expense , huge potential returns ! what do you have to lose ? i invite you to join our mailing list today ! wishing you happy success ! p . p . s . we have a 95 % return at this point ! ! !\\n',\n",

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n\\'t hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider \\'s mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider \\'s mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider \\'s mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp \\'s ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won\\'t happen with ems software since you do n\\'t since you do n\\'t use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to \" forge \" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the \" to \" \" from \" and \" reply to \" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you \\'d need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n\\'t plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n\\'t mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you \\' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n\\'t realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we \\' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our \" global remove list \" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately\\n',\n",

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n\\'t hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider \\'s mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider \\'s mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider \\'s mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp \\'s ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won\\'t happen with ems software since you do n\\'t since you do n\\'t use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to \" forge \" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the \" to \" \" from \" and \" reply to \" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you \\'d need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n\\'t plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n\\'t mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you \\' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n\\'t realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / www . interwise . cc ( if you can\\'t log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we \\' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our \" global remove list \" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully processed immediately * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\\n',\n",

! ! ! ! please accept my apology if this was sent to you in error ! you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 - in less than 90 days read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! . . . hi , my name is jessy lemieux , and i am the one who sent you this e-mail ( if not , someone i sent this to decided to leave my statement ) . first , let me assure you that this is real . i am a senior in high school in victorville , ca ; just an average person just as you probably are , but am already beginning to become wealthy beyond what i have ever dreamed . i can understand if you dont believe me right now , but i urge you to take a little time to read this and maybe think about it for a few days . that s what i did . i recieved this same e-mail about two months ago . i was skeptical , but after some consideration i decided to go for it . i decided that the $ 20 needed to start was worth risking ( besides if it was a scam i was going to go to the police with the addresses below and get the guy running it busted so that he couldn t rip off anyone else ) . well , to my surprise , i received my reports ( you ll find out about those later ) within two weeks via e-mail . soon i got a po box and a list of two million e-mails ( all very easy ) and started sending emails through a bulk email program i downloaded . everything was easy after that , and the cash was rolling in . and thats my story ( i have no reason to lie to you , my address is below and the last thing i want is hate mail for the rest of my life ) . if you are still concerned , write me and i will answer any questions you have . this truly is the opportunity of a lifetime , don t let it pass you by . sincerely , jessy lemieux pres . w . o . w . incorporated dear friend , the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends , and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . i truly believe it was wrong for me to be in debt like this . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share my experience in hopes that this will change your life forever . . . . financially ! ! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i \\'d make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of \\' 96 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i \\' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the \\' internet \\' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does notrequire you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you \\' ll get that big break that you \\' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at m . o . c . marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately !

not only are chain letters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it \\'s simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four 4 financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced ; emailed to the requester . best wishes with the program and good luck ! \" it was truly amazing \" \" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this program . but conservative as i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way that i could not get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i ever surprised when i found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders ! i will make more money this year than any ten years of my life before . \" mary riceland , lansing , mi tips for success send for your four 4 reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in . when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the product / service to comply with us postal and lottery laws . title 18 sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that : \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" while you wait for the reports to arrive : 1 . name your new company . you can use your own name if you desire . 2 . get a post office box ( preferred ) . 3 . edit the names and addresses on the program . you must remember , your name and address go next to report # 1 and the others all move down one , with the fourth one being bumped off the list . 4 . obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you receive the information on mailing list companies in report # 3 . 5 . decide on the number of programs you intend to send out . the more you send , and the quicker you send them , the more money you will make . 6 . after mailing the programs , get ready to fill the orders . 7 . important : always provide same-day service on orders you receive !

i wish you good luck . just one thing though . whatever you do , don t give away the reports . i know its tempting to give them to your friends and relatives . i almost did , but then i began to think what would happen if everyone gave away just 5 reports . do the math and you ll find out that it could cost the people involved literallty hundreds of thousands of dollars . would you want someone to cheat you that way ? it seems harmless but is very damaging to this near perfect system . as long as everyone follows the system , everyone will be rich . sorry if this seemed like common sense to you , its just that excited people like me sometimes don t think about things like this and i wanted to make sure that no one gets cheated out of the work they put into this . once again good luck and don t refrain from writing me if you have any concerns . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - sent using global messenger - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - global messenger is designed to send e-mails to a list of recipients without exposing the recipient list to the recipients . it is an ideal batch e-mail tool for sending newsletters , marketing information , productupdates or other bulk mail materials from a normal ( smtp - compliant ) e-mail client account . allows you to attach files and automatically handles mime , uuencode vist www . global . net for more information - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - unregistered version - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n',\n",

he said , \" sure , no problem \" . so we go watch this great fight on cable pay per view and we are the only two guys at my friends house . after the fight ( since it was so good ) i offered to pay half of the cost for the fight . my friends answer was , \" no , no , that s not necessary . . . i got the fight for free ! \" . i said to him , \" for free , don t those fights cost around $ 40 . 00 a pop ? \" he told me , \" yes , they do , but i bought a cable descrambler box from an acquaintance of mine for $ 300 . 00 \" . he further explained that this \" little black box \" gets all the pay per view events available ! it also tunes in all the premium movie channels and all the adult entertainment channels . my response ( without hesitation ) was , \" i gotta have one ! \" \" $ 300 . 00 , no problem where do i pay ! ! ! \" i m serious , i was excited . lifetime premium movie channels , pay per view and adult entertainment all for a one-time fee of $ 300 . 00 . . . no way ! ! ! \" no way \" was right . the guy that sold my buddy the box was no where to be found . i was really disappointed . it was now time for desperate measures . i begged and pleaded with my friend until he agreed to let me take his box apart piece by piece to see how to make one for myself . luckily it was very easy , if it wasn t simple i knew their was a slight chance it was not going back together so pretty . now the rest is history . . . i ve got my own box which i built with my own two hands . would you like to build one yourself ?

( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that \\'s a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n\\'t take government intervention , we all know that our government could n\\'t feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous \" anti-spammers \" only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n\\'t want it to end because then they would n\\'t have a crusade anymore . think i \\' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n\\'t there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n\\'t easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n\\'t sure ) family member \\' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .\\n',\n",

the bank software that come with a solid database to help you manage your clientele and your fees , and the check writing module that allows you to download check files from the bank and print reatime refunds checks to your clients ; the eepp communication module that makes the transmission of your clients ' return information to the irs as easy as pressing a button ; and finally the eepp windows interface that seamlessly integrates all those valuable goodies in one piece of software . all this for only $ 596 . 00 . no royalty fee to pay , no adversing fee . all the profits are yours to keep . but we still think that an initial investment of $ 596 . 00 in a business you do n't know about may constitute a string significant enough to hold you back . so , to facilitate the entry to new subscribers we pay up to $ 397 . 00 off your first year eepp software package . leaving you with an initial investment of $ 199 . 00 . we are some kind of millionaires who are just giving money away , nor are we going to pretend that we are in this just to help you . no . we are in it just like you to make money . and we make money only when you make money . all the details you might need to understand how the electronic filing program and the eepp offer work are posted on the eepp web site . all the forms and applications you need to sign up , and make payment for subscription fee over the internet are also available on line . but , you will agree with me , if that site was advertised on the giant search engines , the information it contains would not be so valuable because the information it contains would become public domain . your prospective clients could access the same information that makes your business worth what it 's worth . if time is money , business is information . and that is why we give access to the eepp site to people who really mean to be in business . for the web address , and your partner id number ( pidn ) , just reply to this message ( by clicking on the reply to the author icon , if you are using microsoft internet explorer ) , or direct your inquiry and questions to tax _ biz _ 4 _ u @ hotmail . com , call in your inquiry at ( 407 ) 895-2306 . but why pay a phone call when it 's free to email ? do n't wait any longer . some of the discounts are available in limited quantity only .\\n\",\n",

this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again !

! thank you for your time and interest . this is the letter you \\' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved , once and for all , that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless and fun way to make some extra money at home . the results of this show has been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing , much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it . \" here it is below \" = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment and the income return is tremendous !

simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e - mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but over the summer donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating , trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response \" that \\'s why i \\' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \" the enclosed information is something i almost slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year , it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 1 received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , my only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to \" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in . 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to \" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goa . l . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , 1 received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . the economy , inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . 1 do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of programs . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think a-bout it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here \\' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can\\'t sell them if you do n\\'t order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 \\'s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their seqience on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps \" a \" through \" f \" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you \\' ll also see how it does n\\'t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you \\' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 99q out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !

              " 'subject: re : check this out !\\n \\n dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n\\'t believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i \\' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , \" please put me on your mailing list \" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i \\' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that \\'s with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it \\'s more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you \\' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won\\'t be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !\\n',\n",

! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i \\'d make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of \\' 92 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to = make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . = 20 here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted = to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive = 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don \\' t , send out = more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i \\' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! \" threw it away \" \" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn \\' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . \" dawn w . , evansville , in \" no free lunch \" \" my late father always told me , \\' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . \\' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . \" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the \\' internet \\' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you \\' ll get that big break that you \\' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . dothis by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately !

! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i \\'d make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of \\' 92 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to = make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . = 20 here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted = to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive = 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more = programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was = done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you = go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 packets , i received $ 58 , 000 with more = coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in about = 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i \\' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! \" threw it away \" \" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn \\' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . \" dawn w . , evansville , in \" no free lunch \" \" my late father always told me , \\' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . \\' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . \" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the \\' internet \\' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out 20 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 20 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 20 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 2000 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 20 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , now very legal , money making opportunity . it does = not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and = best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you \\' ll get that big break that you \\' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a now perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = 20 to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it \\'s own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that \\'s what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won\\'t get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 usd cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number ( international orders should also include $ 2 usd extra for postage ) = 20 add your e amil address when sending in for your report this is for = 20 updated information and continueing support ( optional ) that will = 20 be handed down by your sponcers pipeline . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" order report # 2 from : j . maz 15774 s . lagrange rd suite # 312 orland pk , il 60462 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : b . thompson 13504 greencaslte ridge tr . 404 burtonsville md . 20866 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : muw # 2 po box 71442 salt lake city , ut 84171-0442 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion one of your free web sites can be registered at = http : / / www . freeyellow . com / . i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . = 20 = = = = = = 09 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - headers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - return - path : received : from relay01 . mail . aol . com ( relay01 . mail . aol . com = [ 170 . 31 . 108 . 127 ] ) by air21 . mail . aol . com ( v37 . 0 ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec = 1997 12 : 34 : 39 - 0500 received : from bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( bonaly . hw . ac . uk [ 130 . 195 . 251 . 5 ] ) by relay01 . mail . aol . com ( 8 . 8 . / 8 . 8 . / aol - 4 . 5 . 0 ) with smtp id maa19336 ; mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) date : mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) from : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no received : from 007 ( sdn-ts - 047mdrelrp11 . dialsprint . net ) by = bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( mx v4 . 2 axp ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec 1997 17 : 29 : 48 + 0000 ( gmt ) to : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no comments : authenticated sender is subject : freefree web site now message - id : = 09 = = 20 - - = 20\\n',\n",

* * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . * send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the orders start coming in because : when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state that \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i \\' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n\\'t matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n\\'t a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i \\'d make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of \\' 92 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to = make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . = 20 here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted = to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not \" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that \" you must receive = 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don \\' t , send out = more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to = 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report = # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , \" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in = every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money !

sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! \" threw it away \" \" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n\\'t have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn \\' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . \" dawn w . , evansville , in \" no free lunch \" \" my late father always told me , \\' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . \\' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . \" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the \\' internet \\' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here \\' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you \\' ll get that big break that you \\' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say \" bull \" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it \\'s own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that \\'s what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won\\'t get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 usd cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number ( international orders should also include $ 2 usd extra for postage ) = 20 add you e amil address when sending in for your report this is for = updated information and continueing support ( optional ) that will be = handed down by you sponcers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales \" order report # 1 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" major corporations and multi-level sales \" j . maz 15774 s . lagrange rd suite # 312 orland pk , il 60462 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" sources for the best mailing lists \" order report # 3 from : b . thompson 13504 greencaslte ridge tr . 404 burtonsville md . 20866 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" evaluating multi-level sales plans \" order report # 4 from : muw # 2 po box 71442 salt lake city , ut 84171-0442 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion . i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . = 20 = = = = = = 20 c = dd\\n',\n",

this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again !

( placing alot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . . . $ 50 , 000 this totals - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! lots of people get 100s of participants ! think about it ! your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists . some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade ! about 50 , 000 new people get online every month ! * * * * * * * tips for success * * * * * * * treat this as your business ! be prompt , professional , and follow the directions accurately . send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when your orders start coming in . when you receive a $ 5 order , you must send out the requested product / report to comply with the u . s . postal & lottery laws , title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 or title 18 , section 3005 in the u . s . code , also code of federal regs . vol . 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which states , \" a product or service must be exchanged for money received . \" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to help assure your success : if you do n\\'t receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n\\'t ; continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash can continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! note : if you need help with starting a business , registering a business name , how income tax is handled , etc . , contact your local office of the small business administration ( a federal agency ) for free help and answers to questions . also , the internal revenue service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes . this letter has been edited to help comply with the federal trade commission requirements . any amounts of earnings listed in this letter can be factual or fictitious . your earnings and results are highly dependent on your activities and advertising . this letter constitutes no guarantees stated nor implied . in the event that it is determined that this letter constitutes a guarantee of any kind , that guarantee is now void . if you have any question of the legality of this letter contact the office of associate director for marketing practices federal trade commission bureau of consumer protection in washington dc . * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won\\'t work and you \\' ll lose a lot of potential income . i \\' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \\' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving \" junk mail . \" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i \" knew \" it would n\\'t work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \" i told you so \" on her when the thing did n\\'t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n\\'t work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her \" hobby . \" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the \" rat race \" and it \\'s not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md i just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . i even checked with the u . s . post office to verify that the plan was legal . it definitely is ! it works ! ! ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family \\'s sake do n\\'t pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending !

! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 \\'s . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but over the summer donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating , trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response \" that \\'s why i \\' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \" with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is johnathon rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n\\'t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month \\'s prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n\\'t tell me i \\'d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1997 i received this program . i did n\\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n\\'t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1-800 - 725-2161 24 - hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided \" why not . \" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n\\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n\\'t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not \" rip-off \" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . your goal is to \" receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don \\' t , send out more programs until you do ! \" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . your goal is to \" receive at least 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . \" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won\\'t work if you do n\\'t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won\\'t work , you \\' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , johnathon rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it \\' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\\'t working . finally , i figured it out . it was n\\'t me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n\\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , \" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . \" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \" move up \" or \" get rich \" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \" no risk \" and \" just a little bit of effort . \" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! \" think about it \" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! jody jacobs , richmond , va here \\' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ instructions : this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say \" bull . . . \" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e-mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do : 1 . order all 4 reports shown on the list below ( you can\\'t sell them if you do n\\'t order them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e-mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the four reports . you will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e-mail , each of the four reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 \\'s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than is instructed below in steps \" a \" through \" f \" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you \\' ll also see how it does n\\'t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you \\' ve ordered the four reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 4 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . d . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 . e . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . f . insert your name / address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 20 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 4 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . in addition you will be provided with information on internet marketing clubs such as internet marketing resources ( imr ) : this is one the premiere internet marketing clubs on the internet . this club provides a forum where internet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets on internet marketing . in addition , this club specializes in providing free internet marketing tools and services for the do - yourself - internet - marketer . they will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1 , 000 , 000 fresh e-mail addresses each week . this club will provide you with hundreds of free resources which include : how to obtain free web sites , how to obtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site , how to send bulk e-mail into aol and compuserve , how to market your products on newsgroups , free classified ads , electronic malls , bulletin boards , banner ads and much more . imr \\' s web address is : http : / / www . ixpres . com / imrs / marketing1 . htm ( not working . . . check the links below ) http : / / www . onlinemlm . com / http : / / www . promlm . com / resources / index . shtml there are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e-mail let \\'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we \\' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let \\'s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that \\'s 10 , 000 $ 5 bills for you . cash ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is free ! ! ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing , tell you where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the \\' net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let \\'s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . ( placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . ) also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below . 1st level - - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 50 2nd level - - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 3rd level - - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4th level - - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 , 000 ) . $ 50 , 000 - - - - - - - - - - - this totals - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - $ 55 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 \\'s of participants ! think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered . that \\' s it ! always provide same-day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can\\'t advertise until they receive the report ! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - available reports - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * * * order each report by number and name * * * notes : - always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report cheques not accepted - always send your order via first class mail - make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper - on one of those sheets of paper , include : ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering , ( b ) your e-mail address , and ( c ) your name & postal address . place your order for these reports now : _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 \" the insider \\'s guide to advertising for free on the internet \" order report # 1 from : aj marketing p . o . box 946 nordvest posthus , glasvej 3 copenhagen denmark _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 \" the insider \\'s guide to sending bulk e - mail on the internet \" order report # 2 from : eyal hilel 21 bar - ilan st . kfar - saba 44378 israel . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 \" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet \" order report # 3 from : dikton haxhijaj homburgerstr . 68 61191 rosbach germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 \" how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of multilevel marketing and the internet \" order report # 4 from : ellbee enterprises p . o . box 452233 los angeles , ca 90045 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ about 50 , 000 new people get online every month !

this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again !

( 2 ) review ( 2a ) # 1 - tufftest - lite - free pc diagnostics utility&nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; [ download @ www . ipcug . org ] &nbsp ; you arrive home with your new computer . sure , it hurt paying $ 1 , 800 , but you have it all - - large cardboard boxes , yards of cables , oceans of foam packing . assembly is a snap . as they told you in the store , every cable only fits one way . you follow all the instructions , turn it on and everything is perfect - you are very proud of yourself . &nbsp ; months later you start to experience mysterious problems and occasional system lock ups . probably some software tsr or driver has conflicted with windows again . as before , you spend endless hours trying to track it down , but this time to no avail . then one day , unfortunately just after the warranty runs out , it stops working . when you boot , you see a cryptic error message that says something about memory , or parity , or some such thing . &nbsp ; maybe you \\' ll spend a lot of time swapping parts and playing with your computer \\'s insides - but if you do n\\'t have the time or the skills , you \\' ll lug the beast down to the repair shop and wait hours for their low-cost \" instant \" diagnostic service . then you \\' ll pay \" more \" to get it fixed . it \\'s moments like these that you need # 1 - tufftest - lite . &nbsp ; # 1 - tufftest - lite by # 1-pc diagnostics company simply makes sure that your equipment is connected and working . before you set off on a software wild goose chase , # 1 - tufftest - lite blows the whistle on faulty hardware , in this case a bad memory simm in main memory . &nbsp ; sophisticated operating systems blur the line between hardware and software . when a program wants to access a drive , memory or port , windows manages the request . many test programs tell you that they are testing the hardware , but they can\\'t really tell if the problem lies with the hardware , the software that controls it or windows . # 1 - tufftest - lite eliminates the problem by eliminating the complex operating system . &nbsp ; the program fits on a floppy disk and contains its own super slim operating system and device drivers . when it runs tests , nothing stands between them and the pc hardware . # 1 - tufftest - lite can directly attack drives , controllers , ports and memory , giving them a stiff workout and telling you whether they pass muster . &nbsp ; interestingly , this handy little utility reports fewer hardware faults than conventional diagnostic programs - - because it virtually eliminates the false positives that can be generated when software gets in the way . when it does report a problem with your equipment , you can be confident that it is worthwhile dismantling the system and making the trip back to the shop . when # 1 - tufftest - lite gives the all clear , it is sensible to assume that the issue is a software or setup one . &nbsp ; for the technically minded , # 1 - tufftest - lite runs a range of standard hardware checks . it starts with the motherboard and looks at the processor , math coprocessor , dma controller and real time clock . from there , it moves through a series of video and alignment and color tests , and onto the video adapter itself . after that , parallel and serial ports , floppy and hard drives and main memory are run through their paces . &nbsp ; one advantage of its small size is that # 1 - tufftest - lite automatically relocates from lower main memory to upper main memory and then back again on every pass . thus all of main memory is tested . no other diagnostics can do this because they have to occupy a large chunk of it themselves . after finishing with a check of extended memory , # 1 - tufftest - lite reports on your pc and its components . it produces a results display with a simple pass or fail for each component . if everything checks out , you have the satisfaction of knowing that your pc \\'s internals are a-ok . &nbsp ; the product does n\\'t assume that you are technically minded . to run it , you turn off your pc , place the # 1 - tufftest - lite diskette in the floppy drive a and turn your pc on . the proprietary boot loader and operating system boots your pc and then automatically runs all the tests , with no user intervention if you like . the tests do n\\'t alter any system settings , so even a novice can use it without fear of doing damage . return after 5-10 minutes and the report will be ready . &nbsp ; there is more to pc problem solving than a basic hardware check , but if you can\\'t do that , you can spend a lot of time looking under the wrong rocks . &nbsp ; best of all , # 1 - tufftest - lite is freeware with no restrictions on its use or distribution so you really can\\'t go wrong giving it a try .

in short , any theme which has relevance to the study and teaching of language and literature and their role in society . the 1992 conference theme to highlight the currently expanding field of discours studies , the 1992 conference has as its core theme \\' literature and the analysis of discourse , with special attention to the multicultural context \\' . papers covering interests as wide as the processes of writing and reading literature , the analysis of dialogic text , oral literary traditions , the relationship between literary and non-literary discourse , discourse theory and literary communication as social practice have all been proposed , as well as those dealing specifically with the writing and reading of literature in a multilingual and / or multicultural context . the 1992 conference venue gent university is of the city type ; there is no campus , and university buildings are dotted around the town . conference sessions will take place in the hoveniersberg , overlooking the bovenschelde in one of the quiet parts of town . programme conference sessions will start on the morning of the wednesday and last a full three days . it is envisaged that most participants will arrive and register on the tuesday evening . our provisional programme looks like this : tuedsday 8 sept 15 . 00 onwards : registration wednesday 9 sept 08 . 30 - 09 . 30 : late registration 09 . 45 : opening of conference 10 . 00 - 18 . 00 : conference sessions 18 . 30 : pre-booked dinner 20 . 15 : drinks reception thursday 10 sept 08 . 30 - 18 . 00 : conference sessions 18 . 30 : pala agm 20 . 00 : pre-booked dinner friday 11 sept 08 . 30 - 17 . 00 : conference sessions 17 . 15 : wind-up session evening : activities to be arranged there will be continuous coffee , tea , etc . throughout the conference sessions . accommodation rooms in the vermeylen student hall of residence , a couple of hundred metres from the conference centre , are available to all participants . it is possible to book rooms for several nights either side of the conference dates . the price on the registration form includes breakfast . unfortunately , no double rooms are available . if you would prefer to stay in a hotel , we recommend the arcade hotel ( nederkouter , 9000 gent ;

( this is one of the basic tenets of stampean natural phonology , unless i \\' m mistaken . ) for example , anyone standing on two hands ( instead of two legs ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the \\' two-leg \\' constraint is almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) is an exemplification , is almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by producing ( 2b ) . but it is a norm , nonetheless . > and what merit is there to making such a distinction > at all ? this distinction is ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarians \\' actual practice . martti nyman , dept of general linguistics , univ of helsinki , finland\\n',\n",

[ on the same theme , i have a paper coming out ( perhaps it has come out already ) in the journal of linguistics on the genealogical connections between prosodic ( firthian ) phonology and autosegemmental phonology . ] dan has also pointed out that some of the major contributors to phonology during this period who are still very much alive and intellectual active have felt slighted by the lack of citation of their work . as i tried to suggest in my paper on firthian phonology , this is more an indictment of normal human expectations of courtesy than it is the result of people actually forgetting about these phonologists ' good , published ideas ( there is much less of that latter sin than many people wish to believe - - a point that geoff huck and i have made in a recent paper on the relation of generative semantics to current syntactic theory ) . however - - and again from a purely human point of view - - i wonder how many people , like myself , who were publishing material on nonlinear phonology in , say , its first ten years ( 1975 to 1985 ) ever received a note from one of these contributers to the literature in the 1940s and 1950s ? speaking just for myself , i am sure i would have been galvanized to have been dropped a note by . . . any of a number of linguists ; in more recent years , i ' ve had the opportunity to discuss the history of the field , in writing and in person , with a number of these linguists . but i would have been absolutely delighted to have received such a comment , a bit of mild reproof perhaps from an established contributor ( who , now , i can perceive as feeling left out ) . i never did . anyone else ? john goldsmith\\n\",\n",

              " 'subject: rules , innateness , psychological reality\\n \\n guido vanden wyngaerd ( vol-3 - 395 ) claims that the wh-island constraint is innate . if it is innate , there is really nothing to explain . to vindicate his claim , wyngaerd purports to show that cognitive principles such as analogy make false predictions about how the structure of yes-no questions is acquired : if it were acquired by analogy , one would expect a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) : ( 1 ) a is [ the man who is tall ] _ _ in the room ? b * is [ the man who _ _ tall ] is in the room ? as the reason for this distributional expectation wyngaerd gives this : > given that the main source of evidence on yes-no questions at the child \\'s > disposal will overwhelmingly consist of simple sentences of the form \" is > the man _ _ in the room \" , the child could make the generalisation either > in way : in terms of linear precedence ( \" front the first finite verb \" , > yielding ( 1b ) ) or in terms of hierarchical structure ( \" front the finite verb > which follows the subject \" , yielding ( 1a ) ) . the fact that children do not > make mistakes in this respect ( ie do not form ( 1b ) ) clearly shows that > the rule is not one learned by experience , the relevant experience not > being rich enough to determine the nature of the rule and not being > able to explain the absence of mistakes . the above passage proves nothing . it would be interesting , indeed , to hear psycholinguists \\' opinions about this kind of conjectural psycholinguistics . meanwhile , let me continue conjecturing , for the sake of argument . that \" the relevant experience [ is not ] rich enough to determine the nature of the rule \" echoes the well-known \\' poverty of stimulus \\' argument , which has never been proven . in the case at hand , it is easy to conjecture what sort of data / experience is relevant for a child to infer that yes-no questions are formed in terms of hierarchical structure . consider where-questions : where is [ x ] ? [ x ] is in z . is [ x ] in z ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - where is [ x who is y ] ? [ x who is y ] is in z . is [ x who is y ] in z ? in principle , analogy works here quite well : the where-question displays the hierarchy which can be analogically extended to other cases . but i am not concerned with whether or not analogy works in this particular case . what i am concerned with is , objecting to wholesale innatism . notice that this does not make me a _ tabula _ rasa _ proselyte . certainly children possess innate cognitive principles and abilities , but from this it does not follow that human beings are necessarily endowed with a grammar as a mental organ ; nor does it follow that the cognitive principles are linguistic or grammatical in nature . it should be clear from my earlier postings that i do not hold that \" children only produce what they hear \" . so , i concur with wyngaerd \\'s view that > children do not hear > forms like \" buyed \" , \" eated \" , or \" goed \" , yet they all go through a stage > where they produce these forms . this can only be because they make > generalizations ( rules , if you like ) , which go beyond what they hear . i expect wyngaerd to concur with me that forms like \" buyed \" , \" eated \" , or \" goed \" are due to analogy . > as far as the rest of nyman \\'s remarks is concerned , i still fail to > see how and why they motivate a distinction between grules and lrules : in his _ knowledge _ of _ grammar _ ( 1986 ) , chomsky speaks of rules as follws : \" it might be appropriate to describe the way a sheep dog collects the flock , or the way a spider spins a web , or the way a cockroach walks in terms of rule following , with reference to underlying \" competence \" consisting of rules of some sort . . . \" ( 239 ) . if you think this is analogical to linguistic behavior , you won\\'t need recognize the conceptual distinction between social norms-of - language ( l - rules as objects of common knowledge ) and theoretical generalizations as formulated by a linguist ( g - rules ) . g ( rammatical ) rules need not be psychologically real , but if they are supposed to be psychologically valid , this means that g - rules are supposed to describe what the internalized rule must consist in ; no one knows how \" brain rules \" are represented ( mentalese ? ) . martti nyman department of linguistics , university of helsinki , finland\\n',\n",

( 1 ) mathematical theory of formal languages . chomsky still gets cited almost automatically for his pioneering work on hierarchies of languages . ( 2 ) philosophy of language . c gets cited a lot for his nativist claims : his arguments are usually rejected . fodor \\'s much more radical nativism gets even more attention and even more rejection . c also gets cited a lot in discussions of wittgenstein , usually as an example of the sort of narrow formalist , rule-based view a language that wittgenstein consistently argued against . ( 3 ) psychology . c has frequently claimed that what he is doing is scientific psychology , but this has failed to impress psychologists . the competence / performance distinction , the autonomous language faculty assumption and the concern with ug all put c \\'s theoretical constructs beyond the ken of most experimental or empirical psychologists . ( 4 ) biology . it would interesting to know if * any * evolutionary biologists have taken up c \\'s views or tried to explain how they could be investigated . again , his views often get mentioned in general introductions . . . but only to be rejected . ( 5 ) cognitive science . as gardner showed in \" the mind \\'s new science \" , c was a source of inspiration . consequently he is cited very frequently in cognitive science literature . again , however , it is his formal , comptuational approach - not his genuinely linguistic work - that are referred to . so , although c is viewed as a founder of cognitive science , his current theory of grammar has had no real impact on the field . in general , it seems that most people outside of linguistics know of chomsky as he appears in \" aspects \" and in the non-technical parts of \" knowledge of language \" . it \\'s surely a safe bet that almost no non-linguist followed him into \" government and binding \" . - philip swann\\n',\n",

( it was thought that a new trait would simply be blended in with already existing traits , instead of remaining a discreet inheritable trait . ) it was n\\'t until mendel \\'s work on heredity was rediscovered ( in the 1930 \\'s , if i recall correctly ) that the theory of evolution had a way of explaining why newly developed traits were not lost in a population like a single water drop would be lost in the ocean . the history of science is full of new theories that appear to have fatal flaws , but the theories are accepted anyway , in faith that an explanation will turn up later . ( another example is the idea that the planets revolve around the sun in space , rather than being attached to crystal spheres that rotate around the earth . what on earth : - ) holds them in their orbits ? ) stemberger also writes : > i \\' ve never understood why it makes any difference at all to linguistic > theory whether highly language-specific information is innate or not . > > yes , it makes a lot of difference for e . g . language acquisition , but that \\'s > beyond the scope of what most linguists do . it \\'s not considered essential > to study the acquisition of warlpiri before you study the adult grammar , > most linguists study only adult grammar , and the main principles of grammar > have come from studies of adult grammar . it makes no difference if you \\' re simply writing grammars that attempt to be descriptively adequate ( in the sense of \" descriptive adequacy \" that chomsky writes about in aspects ) . but it \\'s not clear to me that that is really a theory of anything . if , on the other hand , you want an explanatorily adequate theory of linguistics , you need to worry about how the learner comes up with the right rules . after all , no linguist , even the most brilliant , has ever come up with a descriptively adequate grammar of any language ; whereas every child ( down to some limit at the level of retarded children , i guess ) comes up with a way of producing and understanding his / her language in a descriptively adequate way . regardless of what you believe as to whether the child produces a descriptively adequate grammar , there is a great mystery here . if linguists have n\\'t studied child acquisition ( they have , but stemberger is using a slight hyperbole here ) , it \\'s simply because they have made a decision about how to investigate the problem , not because they do n\\'t thing that \\'s the real problem . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * mike maxwell phone : ( 704 ) 843-6369 jaars internet : maxwell @ jaars . sil . org box 248 waxhaw , nc 28173\\n',\n",

bar notation for immediate constituent analysis , though of course not by that name , to cope with the well known weakness of ic analysis with the head-of relation . he developed ways to accomodate discontinuous morphemes into grammatical analysis . he charted a way out of difficulties experienced by bloch and others in phonology , by saying that contrast rather than phonetic identity is the basis for setting up phonemes , a ghost that has risen to haunt generative phonology more than once . he invented string analysis as a complement ( not rival ) to immediate constituent analysis . their complementarity with respect to the head-of problem is the basis of joshi \\'s tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . he invented transformational analysis in context of developing discourse analysis to get at the information content of texts . other contributions await recognition and exploitation in the field of linguistics as institutionalized today , and in other fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis and sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based on word dependency , discourse analysis for information content , and his theory of information as an account of a central aspect of semantics . for example , string grammar and its natural extension into transformational grammar is the basis of the very successful work of naomi sager and others at nyu in information formatting of sublanguage texts , applied there mainly to medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented a system for representing the information content of texts , based on operator grammar . successes of this sort are little noticed within linguistics . it is characteristic of harris that there was no vanity or self importance in him . he knew that his work was of lasting importance , and treated it as such , but he was no guru or empire builder seeking followers , and would not accept any such role being projected onto him . those students who sought entree to linguistics as a social institution in academia were bound to be disappointed . however , he could scarcely be blamed for their disappointment . he did not provide such entree , nor did he pretend to , and in my hearing actively discouraged students who imagined work with him would further their ambitions in the field . once , in my role as ta for john fought , i prepared a lecture on harris \\'s approach to syntax and semantics . as we were setting out for the lecture hall , we encountered harris , and i blurted out \" i \\' m about to give a lecture on your theory to john \\'s class . \" ( john , with characteristic wry humor , asked if he wanted to take anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone would be interested in what he was doing . nonetheless , when he gave a public lecture on \" the two structures of language : report and paraphrase \" in 1969 or 1970 , the large auditorium ( i think it was in the furness building ) was filled to capacity , and the critique by john corcoran , published later in the volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited by senta ploetz , was also well attended . broad attendance on and acclaim for his work could easily have been his , had he chosen it . that is simply not where his ambitions lay . a clue as to the basis of this choice against fame and influence may perhaps be found in his advice to a student starting out in his first teaching position , many years ago . do n\\'t invite anybody over for dinner , he said , and do n\\'t accept any invitations . if you get involved in the social life of an academic , you won\\'t be able to get any work done . the work came first . harris was always an intensely loyal man to his friends and family . the consequences , when combined with his laissez-faire anarchism , were not always happy . his friend and close colleague of many years , henry hiz , was much more concerned with building a formal linguistics program as an institution . the disparity of character could be devastating to students . i studied with harris from 1966 through 1970 . i was an undergraduate much of that time , but that did not matter to him . he had a sink-or - swim approach like that attributed to sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except that his seminars were of course focussed on theory rather than the data of , say , athabaskan . he would come in to his seminar and just start talking about what he was working on . when i started with him , this was the work that resulted in his 1968 book , _ mathematical structures of language _ ( wiley ) . the process was not a lecture or monologue , but a continuing conversation with his students , trying out alternatives , posing and working out problems for a mathematical characterization of language . after a while , with intensive reading outside , one began to catch on and to participate . i recall telling him at the end of one seminar meeting in my first year that i would try to disprove his theory . this troubled him not a bit . i worked up a problem in modern greek that i thought might be troublesome for his approach . ( i had lived in greece for a couple of years , and spoke the language , but i worked with an informant for this project . ) when my results turned out actually to corroborate the point i had intended to challenge , he merely thanked me for the data on greek . a year or two later , i had come up with a proposal to analyze definitions in a dictionary to extract semantic primitives by a form of componential analysis , much as martha evens and now others have done . although the notion of semantic features seems inimical in concept and method to his work , he said ( and this is an exact quote ) \" others have tried this and have failed , but you are welcome to try . \" i offer this in refutation of the sometimes heard view that harris was dictatorial . i ran into conflicts in such matters with hiz , never with harris . i have also heard it asked why he never retorted to attacks on his work . i think it did not matter to him . he did not expect his methods and results to be understood and taken up by everyone in the field of linguistics . maybe his attitude differed in the 1940s , when he wrote the structural restatements and the manuscript eventually published as _ methods in structural linguistics _ . ( btw , the title was to have said \" descriptive \" but the publisher substituted the buzzword \" structural . \" i recall him saying , amusedly , \" i do n\\'t remember whether they asked me or not . \" ) maybe his expectations of the field changed after some of chomsky \\'s followers began making him out to be the bad guy . i do n\\'t think so , based on his writings and on the testimony of some who were his students then . i never heard him comment on the commonplace attribution to chomsky of the discovery of transformational grammar and the \" transformational revolution . \" there is a passage in _ the state of the art _ ( 1968 ) in which hockett attributes to harris \" nothing , or a long silence , after 1957 , \" showing ignorance not only of things like string analysis , for which he might be excused , but even ignoring the 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published in _ language _ . i showed this passage to harris , and he shrugged . it did not matter . in particular , i never saw any evidence that harris opposed or blocked chomsky \\'s ambitions . in my experience it would have been entirely out of character for him . for example , it was harris who proposed chomsky to speak in his stead to the 1962 international congress . a similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid to rest in an editorial in language . one must i think be alert to the social psychology that leads some people to rewrite history so that their avatar is depicted as an embattled hero . now , an old indian friend once told me that one cannot point a finger without having three other fingers of the same hand pointing back , so i hasten to add that this is not the picture i intend to paint here of harris . he accomplished what he intended to quite well , thank you very much , and seems to have been quite happy in the process . the point is precisely that he seemed in no way embattled by attacks and uncomprehending misconstruals of his work . and uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley \\'s review of _ a grammar of english on mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is a good example . he identifies harris \\'s operator grammar with predicate calculus , though harris is at pains to delineate critical differences between language ( a fortiori operator grammar ) and language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley can see in this comprehensive grammar only an attempt to do 1960s generative grammar in 1980 , because he is unable to step out of the generativist paradigm so as to understand harris \\'s work on its own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 in _ computers in the humanities _ ) asserted that harris \\'s grammar was unable to account for certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , the semantics of find vs . seek , and quantifier scope in examples like \" someone was opposed by everyone . \" in my review ( _ computational linguistics _ in 1984 ) i showed how harris did in fact account of each of these problems in the book . michael kac , in his review of harris \\'s selected writings , asked \" why bother ? \" and indeed , from within the generativist paradigm that must be the only plausible question . it is only in setting aside paradigmatic blinkers that one can see , having these writings in one place , how consistent and self coherent harris \\'s program has been over the years . transformational grammar was not a revolutionary break but part of a continuous evolution . i will mention only one other misconception about harris \\'s work , not because it is in any way fundamental but because it is so commonplace . i probably will be greeted with disbelief when i say that discovery procedures were not his aim . ( jim mccawley \\'s witticism about harris and discovery procedures in the collection traditionally circulated in may really reverses the roles of the teller and the butt of the joke . ) it is not hard to see how linguists have come to this mistaken belief . discovery procedures are an abiding fixture for linguistics as institutionally defined . when _ methods _ was published , linguists sought an aid to fieldwork and writing of linguistic descriptions . now , discovery procedures are institutionalized as a whipping boy . this has colored perceptions of harris \\'s intentions and results . for harris , it was certainly of interest and value when redundancy on one level of linguistic representation could be used in a practical way to determine boundaries of objects on the next , but this was a corroborative byproduct , not an aim . the \" constructional procedure \" described in the 1955 paper from phoneme to morpheme was implemented in fortran in the early 1960s and proven to work , and ralph grishman has had some preliminary success in implementing programs to discover word classes and rules of sublanguage grammar from sublanguage texts . but in general harris did not think that discovery procedures were feasible . in particular , he told me he thought that grammatical analysis could not be done solely with a corpus or by asking informants , one had to control the language oneself . and then one had to work over the data to tease out pattern and wrestle it into coherent form , a lengthy and demanding process , as probably most of us know from experience . so much for the popularized image of feeding in a corpus , turning a crank , and having a grammar reel out the other end . in the introduction to _ methods in structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly that these methods are not discovery procedures . he accepts that one uses many means to come up with proposals for describing what is going on in a language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules of thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison with related languages or earlier stages of the language , and so on , more art than science ( or rather , more art than engineering ) . harris was acutely aware of the danger of swamping one \\'s control of the language by growing familiarity with marginal examples . language is after all a social institution , continuously in change as it is constantly recreated in the crucible of use . the aim of the methods was not to substitute for these informal ways of coming up with possible analyses , but to verify , for any given result , whether the result had a valid relation to the data of the language . of those who have actually read the book , how many have said ( and some have in fact said to me ) \" he did n\\'t really mean that . \" but if nothing else , harris was always careful to say exactly what he meant . this concern for verification arises out of a deeper concern which becomes more explicit in harris \\'s later work . this is a critical point for linguistics . for any other science , there is a standpoint external to the science domain for its metascience . in particular , practitioners in physics , chemistry , even in mathematics , rely on the \" background vernacular \" of language to ensure communication about shared meanings and ultimately to validate the relation of conclusions , however reached , to the observations on which they are based . not so for a science of language . harris recognized and accepted that there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . and , observably , each language contains its own metalanguage . i \\' ll repeat that , because it is i think a key to understanding what harris was about , and because it is easy to overlook its importance . there is no vantage point outside of language from which to describe language . by contrast , generativist theory postulates a universal metalanguage , external to language , that is part of one \\'s biological endowment . ( i personally do not find this biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine of mental organs credible , but the issue rests not on opinion but on facts yet to be determined . ) this stance seems to me perfectly consonant with the argument made by stephen anderson in \" why phonology is n\\'t natural . \" one cannot derive linguistic structure from the findings of some study bearing a metascience relation to linguistics . harris was interested in how language can carry or transmit information , and this is the thread that underlies the really remarkable consistency in his work over more than 50 years . intuitively , we know that differences in form correlate with differences in meaning , but the correlation is messy and inconsistent in the observed data of language ( say , in a body of writings or of phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances the investigator may come up with in the ad hoc search for examples ) . what harris found was how this messy , inconsistent stream of words can be the product of two concurrent systems : a system of word dependencies that correlates with perceptions in a subject-matter domain such as a science subfield , and a system of reductions that changes word shapes ( often to zero ) , motivated in part by issues of redundancy and efficiency and in part by historically contingent social convention . the reductions introduce degeneracies such as ambiguity and paraphrase , and otherwise obscure the correlation of form with meaning , but without destroying that correlation . given that structure ( differences of form ) correlates with meaning , it is of critical importance that the machinery of description not import any structure extraneous to that found in language . harris \\'s endeavor was always , then , to determine a \" least grammar , \" a description that required an absolute minimum of primitive objects and relations . any additional objects or relations in the description introduce extrinsic structure that obscures the informational structure in language . this could be the basis for a telling critique of various other theories of language . harris chose not to make such a critique . when i asked him once about certain aspects of generativist theory , he would only comment , with evidence of mild amusement , that it did seem to be over-structured . like his teacher , sapir , harris had an interest in problems of international communication and an international auxiliary language . ( a paper on this appeared in a 1962 volume on avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) and like sapir and bloomfield he had in particular a long standing interest in international cooperation and communication in science . this culminated in _ the form of information in science : analysis of an immunology sublanguage _ ( with michael gottfried , tom ryckman , and others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . this book describes the grammar of the sublanguage of immunology during a specific period in the development of that field , based on discourse analysis of sublanguage texts from that period and adequate for making explicit the information structures in arbitrary other texts in that sublanguage . the analysis shows how the structure of the sublanguage changed concurrently with a change in immunologists \\' perceptions in the domain of their science . a difference in informational structure correlates with a difference in meaning . the informational structures that are clearly represented in the binary array resulting from discourse analysis are still present in the actual form of the source texts as written albeit obscured under reductions in word shape , some motivated by considerations of informational efficiency and avoidance of redundancy , some dictated by conventions of language use as a human social institution . harris arranged his life so as to enhance the autonomy of his work . i understand that his kibbutz in israel is a wealthy one , to which members give their assets and income , and which in turn supports them in their needs . i believe that the kibbutz purchased his apartment building on charles street . until his retirement , he held an endowed chair at penn , the benjamin franklin professorship in linguistics . he was principal investigator for a long series of grants from the nsf , nimh , and other agencies whose committees and referees found his work of continuing value . throughout his life he was involved with scientists and science . his wife was a physicist at the university of jerusalem , and had been albert einstein \\'s assistant at princeton . a brother was an immunologist ( he is an author of some of the work analyzed in the 1989 book ) . he felt that the rough and tumble of polemic attack and retort was inappropriate for science , and would not participate in it . that too would be a distraction from the work . after one of the bampton lectures at columbia in 1986 , a young member of the audience approached him and asked what he would take up if he had another lifetime before him . he mentioned poetry , especially the longer works of 19th century poets like browning . he mentioned music . and he mentioned sign language . he had a long and very productive life . he had brought his life \\'s work to a successful culmination . with the completion of his book on politics , i imagine death coming to him , as to the chess playing knight in the seventh seal , and him saying \" ok , i \\' m ready now . \" it was a privilege to know him and to learn from him . he is an abiding inspiration . bruce nevin bn @ bbn . com\\n',\n",

\" he queried . responses to raskin \\'s question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called \" linguistnet \" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee \\'s curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee \\'s attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition \\'s organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee \\'s decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into \" linguistnet \" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . \" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher \" , she said wednesday . \" young children , almost universally , pick up their accents from their peers . \" she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country , they would find that the children have not adopted their parents \\' accent . many others agreed . \" i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played the organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest , \" craig thiersch , a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said . \" but all their children had strong \\' towny \\' accents . \" \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n\\'t influenced by the foreign accents of their parents , much less their teachers , \" echoed university of georgia professor michael a . covington . \" kids get their accents from their peers , \" agreed susan ervin - tripp from the university of california at berkeley . while the linguists roundly criticized the petition , some said they could understand why some parents signed it . noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors , they acknowledged that a teacher \\'s english should be understandable . but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor , they said . \" my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students , but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition , \" partee said . she said at umass , foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood . \" but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent . \" [ end of newpaper article . ] in the same paper , there was a nice column by william raspberry . much of it repeats things we \\' ve been over on the net ; i extract here a bit from the ending : \" as one who was taught french by a german - accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of \" consonants and wowels , \" i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard . but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard ? and who determines it ? how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers ? how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin ? where is the universal principle ? kant might not want to hear this , but the principle is the problem . a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat . she \\'d listen , make some experience-based judgment as to whether a teacher \\'s accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment . she might not even be able to tell you , in close cases , what tipped the judgment one way or another , but would that really be so awful ? only if you try to make it a kantian universal . make it a principle , and you \\' re stuck willy-nilly with language panels , ethnic spokespersons , teachers \\' union reps and , of course , lawyers . before it \\'s over , people will stop speaking to each other across racial or ethnic lines , and everybody will be working to get everybody else fired or defeated for re-election . the problem , of course , will remain unresolved . as they say in massachusetts ( or would if they thought of it ) , some things can be addressed in terms of the philosopher \\'s \" universal law . \" some kant .\\n',\n",

( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph \" linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good \" model \" in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . \" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades \" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . \" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city \\'s school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state \\'s secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal \" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . \" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as \" bovine scatology . \" the state \\'s attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state \\'s anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i \\' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday \\'s nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , \" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . \" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there \\'s a great deal of debate about whether it \\'s racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? \" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote : \" by the way , i heard second hand that the school committee or a subcommittee thereof just voted this morning 3 - 0 not to adopt the petitioners \\' request . i \\' ll know more by this evening \\'s news . i expect the newspaper article that our stuff went to will appear tomorrow morning . i \\' ll let you know . this is happening quicker , and coming out more emphatically on the right side , than i had expected . \" the article appeared on friday , july the 10th , and barbara is likely to post it here on monday . as you will see , the reporter was absolutely fascinated by the fact of the ongoing worldwide discussion of the issue on a computer net . the same issue of the same paper ran a syndicated column by william raspberry on the subject . i have not yet found a paper available here that runs bill raspberry . that was the chronicle , and now for the substance of the responses . a couple of people suggested that the petitioners \\' concern was about the teachers being comprehensible to the grade school students . this is , of course , a most legitimate concern , and many states , school corporations , and universities have taken measures to protect their students from incompetent english speakers . apparently , however , this was not the petitioners \\' concern , and the core of the issue was their belief that the students would acquire the foreign accent of a teacher . all the responses on this subject shared the conviction that it could not happen . michael covington ( mcovingt @ uga . cc . uga . edu ) : \" my own rather limited experience is that children are n\\'t even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . \" cliff miller ( miller @ defun . cs . utah . edu ) : \" of course it is possible [ for a grade school student to be influenced by the teacher \\'s foreign accent ] , but it is highly unlikely that it will be complete or long-lasting . and perhaps the more important question is : does it matter ?

) . but i think the matter is quite more complicated that all that has been mentionned so far . . . first the chinese case seems to me very complicated and specific : a - there is a chinese \" isolat \" for about 4000 years ( quite no interaction with other cultures , except the bouddhist indian one , where it gave rise to a quite specific \" sub-language \" , mainly phonetic transcription of samskrit words into adapted-on - purpose chinese characters , but which has little to do with generic chinese , b - there is a feed-back from the ideographs , so that chinese language does n\\'t evolve independantly from its writing since a long time , c - because the phonologic evolution of the spoken language is not directly reflected onto the writing system , which builts upon its own logic , it is possible that its laws of evolution could be very different from languages using alphabetic or syllabic systems of notation ( ? ) . more : my french is certainly influenced by the english i use on internet , and the chinese i use in day-to - day life ( to the point that i sometimes realise that , while talking to my sister in france by phone , i find myself unthinkingly telling her : \" j \\' habite dans une petite hsiang derriere l \\' ecole . \" ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ( i live in a little hsiang just behind the school - - \" hsiang \" being the chinese for a little alley connected to a main street ) . and having to apologize and reexplain . . . but i mainly switch between the languages , and there is little chance i create my own pidgin or creole . . . so do many taiwanese ( min-nan ) speaking people in the south of the island . . . so does it not mean that the evolution should depend on the education level of people - so that it would be differential inside a society according to , say , the social class ? there is probably as well a \" critical mass effect \" ( if france was turned into some chinese-dominant state . . . ) . is not our idea of \" homogeneity \" in evolution vitiated by the pretention of modern nation-states to generate a \" super-culture \" - through linguistic homogeneisation ? ) - i am also aware of phenomenons of resistance to acculturative evolution ( conscious or not ) as for the quebecquois telling , not \" un hot-dog \" as the french do , but \" un chien chaud \" ( toubon being in my opinion but a marginal impedement on the natural evolution , whatever direction it takes ) . . . - another exemple of the complexity of those issue would be the \" rigidification \" of a language facing a threat . it was given to me as an explanation when i was a student of kurdish , when i learnt that this language has in common with old persian an \" ergative \" ( ? ) construction for transitive verbs in past tenses , which was presented to me as a \" quite - passive \" construction . to allow for comparisons by more knowledgeable people , i will explain a little : there , the infix representing the agent is appended at the end of the verb , while the infix representing the subject is appended after the object , as : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xuward - 0 ( - eke and ek ( [ ^ e ] k ) being suffixes expressing definiteness ( eke = the ) ( child-the apple-one - he ate ) and indefiniteness respectively ( ek = a ) ) here , - y represents the child , - 0 a null infix ( there is only one apple ) , so \" the child ate the apples \" would be : mindal-eke sew - ek - y xiward-n < - - - - \" - n \" : there are several apples ( child-the apples-the - he ate-them ) so i was told at this time that this construct , which was used in old persian ( and is still used in the variety of persian spoken in afghanistan , is an archaic construction , characteristic of the periphery of the indo-iranian domain , that is , in kurdistan ( south-kurmandji , or sorani-speaking part ) , and also among the baluches , and represents a rigidification of the language due to a threat from other languages , ( so that languages at a domain periphery would sometimes evolve more slowly ) and that it has disappeared from standard modern persian . . . i would want to know if all that is still considered true , though . what do you think of it ? i guess there are as well different levels of evolution taking place simultaneously , that can be contradictory ( phonology , vocabulary , syntax . . . ) . anyway , i see several reasons why it should be difficult to infer any \" linear \" evolution of languages ( whatever fascination i feel when i read posts speaking of modelisations of 10 or 20 000 years back . . . ) on anything else that a case-by - case basis ( or does the fact that populations densities has obviously undergone a dramatic change since then , changing the dynamics of contacts . . . ? ? ? ? ) . to resume my questions : how can we ascertain that this language has had this reaction without having to resort to extra-linguistic implicit hypothesis as : homogeneity through classes , identity of evolution whatever the number of speakers would be ( lng-switching vs creolisation . . . ) , existence ( or not ) , type , and evolution of a scripting system ( * * ) etc . . . ? as i told , i am no linguist , ( neither \" linguistician \" nor philologist : ) , so i hope i did not waste your time , thus getting all your community angry at me ( ack ! - terrible perspective ) . but i will be very interested to read more about all this . friendly to all , gerard gautier ( * * ) once more , kurdish would be a good case in point , as it uses up to three different scripting systems according to the place ( latin , arabo-persian , cyrillic for the north-kurmandji , and latin and arabo-persian for sorani ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ wen-tzao school | \\\\ | / / gerard gautier of foreign languages | / \\\\ \\\\ | . . \\\\ | \\\\ | | _ _ > | _ / \\\\ _ > o _ _ _ > kaohsiung - taiwan _ / _ / . . _ / ( _ s . . _ / gauier @ cc . nsysu . edu . tw ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\\n',\n",

- in other words , as if there had been leftists ( in the us ) who applied the term to themselves without irony . now , what had been something of an inside leftwing joke has been turned into a weapon brandished against the left . for example , in 1982 , say , a leftist might have blown off steam about some dogmatic person or organization by characterizing her or it as \" politically correct . \" but now i hear the term used by non-leftists , often to evoke an image of rigid leftist / multi-culturalist / academic types taking over our institutions and seeking to control our minds - - as if such a move were afoot , and as if the left had that much power . at this point , if \" politically correct \" ever regains an ironic connotation , perhaps it will be as a word that makes fun of the political right . for example , sometimes i hear people call each other \" commie \" or \" pinko \" in a manner whose real intent is to make fun of the prejudices of anti-communists . i could imagine that \" politically correct \" might one day be used similarly . sincerely , seth\\n',\n",

              " \"subject: summary : basic order ( and remarks on typology )\\n \\n last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .\\n\",\n",

( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it \\'s different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it \\'s especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that \\'s because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i \\' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really \\'s now \\' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ?

              " \"subject: typological classification\\n \\n a few remarks on fritz newmeyer 's posting on classification in language typology : of course it is not always easy to decide to which type a given language should be assigned , since there may be conflicting criteria . but some people seem to think that this is somehow a deep problem with language typology . in reality , there is no deep problem here at all , so the typological literature is quite right in not dwelling on such trivial methodological points too much , concentrating on substantive and theoretical issues instead . true , the methodology of language typology is somewhat different from the methodology used in single-language studies that most linguists engange in . when searching for significant correlations between features / parameters in the world 's language , one has to classify languages , and the more languages one looks at , the less energy one can spend on resolving each individual case . clearly , the speacialist will sometimes disagree with the way her or his language was assigned , but then most of them time not all specialists agree on the right classification themselves . when the criteria are in conflict , it may sometimes be necessary to give more weight to some than to others in a somewhat arbitrary way - - but this is simply one reflection of the necessary idealization that accompanies any serious scientific endeavor . it 's as simple as that : the more one studies linguistic phenomena in breadth , the more one loses in depth . but vice versa , linguists that study only one or a few languages are working on an extremely narrow basis and lose in breadth what they gain in depth . ideally , typological research should be conducted by teams of linguists , much in the same way as research in big science is organized . with more resources that are combined , one could study linguistic phenomena in considerable breadth and depth simultaneously . an attempt to follow this strategy has been made in the european science programme in language typology , which has been running in europe for the past five years ( wait for 10 volumes on the typology of european languages , to appear with mouton de gruyter in a year 's time ) . this was only a very modest , seriously underfunded attempt , but until we attract really big research money or manage to agree on more things , we have to be happy that we have colleagues like johanna nichols who are willing to make enormous efforts to get a view of linguistic phenomena on a global scale . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )\\n\",\n",

( both are singaporean dialects of languages whose standard varieties do n\\'t satisfy these conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . \" kucing \" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiners \" itu \" ( that / the ) and ini \" ( this ) are unmarked for number , eg . \" seekor kucing itu \" ( that / the one cat ) , \" dua ekor kucing itu \" ( those / the two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns in construction with \" itu \" and ini \" tend to be interpreted as singular , eg . \" kucing itu \" ( that / the cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , there is some variation here between speakers , and between different constructions for the same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked for number , eg . \" cat \" ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessors such as \" john \\'s \" are unmarked for number , eg . \" john \\'s one cat \" ( john \\'s one cat ) , \" john \\'s two cat ( s ) \" ( john \\'s two cats ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmarked nouns are preceded by prenominal possessors , the resulting construction can only be interpreted as singular , eg . \" john \\'s cat \" ( john \\'s cat / * cats ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above cases , an unmarked noun plus an unmarked determiner results in a singular np . are there any cases where the result is a plural np ?

              " 'subject: lx as * science * ?\\n \\n i accept the editors \\' recent challenge for resuming last year \\'s thread ( which i missed , before subscribing ) on whether linguistics is / should be considered a science - - by which i am assuming everyone means newtonian * science * rather than the quantum / relativity science which has been current during this century . [ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 \\'s when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i \\' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists \\' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it \\'s * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n\\'t there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where \\'s our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can\\'t stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic \\' attractors \\' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein \\'s relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a \" pseudo-science \" , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n\\'t need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : \" logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval \\'s most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be \\'s cientific \\' - - then it had to be \\' logical \\' \" . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , \" [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? \" [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a \\'s hamanic stance \\' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as \\' cause \\' and \\'d etermine \\' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( \" what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . \" ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word \\' karma \\' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the \\' comes around \\' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning \\'d irect object of verb \\' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < \" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round \" > < - - john lennon >\\n',\n",

the bounded constructions . the present paper offers a theory of binding in ccg which preserves the original account of the unbounded dependencies , and which renders it immediately compatible with other theories , tag in particular . the theory requires the abandonment of one assumption that has been traditional ( though not essential ) in other categorial approaches . the significance of the move is discussed . ircs-94 -

drop analysis of rizzi ( 1994 ) . we argue contra sano & hyams ( 1994 ) that these missing subjects are instances of pro , not pro , and demonstrate that the economy-based pro-drop theory of speas ( 1994 ) handles our data in an elegant fashion . the analysis we propose links the acquisition of subjects to the acquisition of functional morphology , in accordance with the minimalist program developed since chomsky ( 1989 ) . one desirable consequence of the approach taken here is that no recourse to a pro-drop parameter is necessary . ircs-94 -

              " 'subject: typological method\\n \\n pace fritz newmeyer , there has been extensive discussion of the methodological issues that he raises . ( these remarks are independent of any assessment of johanna nichol \\'s book that fritz referred to , incidentally . ) first , good typological work devotes a substantial amount of effort to defining and delimiting what sorts of constructions should or should not belong to a particular structural type . good examples are many of dryer \\'s papers ( e . g . dryer 1989a , 1989b , 1992 ) , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 : ch . 1 - 3 on nominalizations , stassen 1985 : ch . 2 , 4 on comparative and \\' chaining \\' constructions , and haspelmath 1993 : ch . 2 on indefinite pronouns . more generally , the discussion of the proper typological markedness criteria in croft 1990 : ch . 4 - 6 is an attempt to provide some * general * structural criteria for a large class of cross-linguistic phenomena ( see for example the formulation of the structural consequences of hopper & thompson 1980 \\'s transitivity hypothesis on p . 131 , or the application of the criteria to the syntactic category problem in croft 1991 : ch . 2 - 3 ) . delimiting and classifying the phenomena to be analyzed is not a simple descriptive task ; in fact , it raises some of the most interesting issues in typological analysis , and have hardly been ignored in the typological literature . second , with respect to basicness for a language type in particular , in the passage from croft 1990 that fritz referred to ( pp . 33-36 ) , i argued that typologists had moved from classifying languages typologically to classifying constructions typologically , and that that was a good thing . nevertheless , i suggested some general criteria for determining a \" basic \" language type . and despite my reservations about identifying \" basic \" language types , it has to be said that in the great majority of cases , defining a \" language type \" instead of a \" construction type \" is not terribly difficult . matthew dryer ( p . c . ) has observed that inspection of texts generally tells you very quickly what the \" word order type \" of a language is . in my own experience , in a study where i am comparing the syntax of prenominal and postnominal modifiers , i am quite frustrated at how difficult it is to find languages where a modifier freely occurs both pre - and postnominally . of course , identification of \" basic \" or other types depends on what resources you have available to you ( quality of grammatical descriptions , availability of texts / language consultants etc . ) as well as what phenomenon you are studying ( e . g . word order or head marking [ easier ] vs . relative order of modifiers or the syntax of nonrestrictive modification [ harder ] ) . but for most studies it is not an insurmountable problem , although there always some problematic cases . third , the sampling problem * has * been discussed at some length by typologists ( besides bell 1978 \\'s seminal article , see also dryer 1989c , perkins 1989 , croft 1990 : 18-25 , rijkhoff et al . 1993 ) . the issues are too complex to go into here at length . but it should be pointed out that the issues fritz raises apply to different sorts of samples with different purposes in mind . the question of how independent particular instances are have to do with probability samples ( see in particular the dryer , perkins and croft references for discussion of these problems ) . note in particular that the stability of the phenomenon being studied is an important factor : the less stable it is , the more likely cases are historically independent . the question of coming across rare types pertains to variety samples ( see in particular rijkhoff et al . ) . some studies ( e . g . tomlin 1986 , koptjevskaja - tamm 1990 , haspelmath 1993 ) draw on a very large variety sample and then select a stratified probability sample from it for the appropriate generalizations . dryer \\'s sampling technique attempts to combine the needs of variety and probability samples into a single sampling procedure . i should also add that with the shift towards dynamic ( diachronic ) interpretations of synchronic typological patterns , the examination of cognate phenomena in related languages , and the comparison of \" nonbasic \" as well as basic typological strategies , becomes another important method of analysis . that means that to some extent , the problems of basic vs . nonbasic types in a single language , and of historical relatedness of data sets , can be avoided - - - in fact , exploited - - - in modern typological analysis . bill croft references : bell , alan . 1978 . language samples . universals of human language , vol . 1 : method and theory , ed . joseph h . greenberg , charles a . ferguson and edith a . moravcsik , 123-156 . stanford : stanford university press . croft , william . 1990 . typology and universals . cambridge : cambridge university press . - . 1991 . syntactic categories and grammatical relations : the cognitive organization of information . chicago : university of chicago press . dryer , matthew . 1989a . plural words . linguistics 27 . 865-95 . - . 1989b . article - noun order . cls 25 . 84-97 . - . 1989c . large linguistic areas and language sampling . studies in language 13 . 257-92 . - . 1992 . the greenbergian word order correlations . language 68 : 81 - 138 . hopper , paul and sandra a . thompson . 1980 . transitivity in grammar and discourse . language 56 . 251-299 . koptjevskaja - tamm , maria . 1988 . a typology of action nominal constructions . stockholm : university of stockholm . perkins , revere d . 1989 . statistical techniques for determining language sample size . studies in languagea013 : 293-315 . rijkhoff , jan , dik bakker , kees hengveld & peter kahrel . a method of language sampling . studies in language 17 . 169-203 . stassen , leon . 1985 . comparison and universal grammar . oxford : basil blackwell . tomlin , russell . 1986 . basic word order : functional principles . london : croom helm . dept of linguistics , u manchester , oxford rd , manchester m13 9pl , uk w . croft @ manchester . ac . uk fax : + 44-61 - 275 3187 phone : 275 3188\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( and remarks on typology )\\n \\n fritz newmeyer raises some important issues about typological research as instantiated in nichols \\' work and elsewhere , which call for some comments . first , the notion of language type is an idealization : this is often made clear in typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered as logically possible or impossible language types , if not always in the published literature ( though the point is clearly made in comrie \\'s textbook , for example , by the discussion of morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right to point out that the assumption of no areal or genetic bias , to the extent that it is made at all , is a counterfactual one . what i would ask is whether such idealizations differ in kind from those , many of them counterfactual , which underlie generative grammar . the justification is similar in both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal with all the relevant variables all the time , and some of the concepts used are logically independent of the extrinsic variables , e . g . one can investigate consistency with proposed implicational universals regardless of the statistical bias in one \\'s sample . the term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing \\' is particularly inapt as applied to nichols \\' distinction between head-marking and dependent - marking languages , which is quite explicitly a matter of degree ( see her 1986 paper where the degree of hm vs . dm is quantifified in terms of the number of patterns instantiating each type ) . if nichols refers to a ` head-marking language \\' this is shorthand for a quantifiable tendency , just as we might describe italian as a ` pro-drop language \\' without implying that there is a binary distinction here ( in fact there are degrees of pro-drop , e . g . some languages allow null expletives but not null referential subjects , etc ) . another point which i think all typologists would accept is that languages which do n\\'t appear to match an established type are typological data - for example , colloquial french as discussed recently on linguist is a language which might reasonably be described as having no basic word order ( i believe that nichols classified it as vso in one of her tables , but that is again shorthand for a more complex situation ) . this is an explanandum for which nichols \\' 1986 paper offers an explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , and colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking in nichols \\' sense . to sum up : pace widespread opinion , typologists \\' goal is not pigeon-holing ( \" taxonomy \" is also widely used in this context ! ) but the investigation and explanation of patterns of variation . steve matthews\\n',\n",

( it may be of interest to add that the other great issues regarding \" primitive \" languages was whether they possess clearly defined sounds , since it was widely claimed that speakersof such languages \" alternate \" between different pronunications . it was boas who showed that this was an illusion , but i think that many people would not listen , and that works such as sapir \\'s paper on the sound pattenrs and even on psychological reality are largely to be understoods as attempts to defend the boas position ) . in any case , it should be clear that the issue was never how many words a language might have for specific kinds of anything , but whether it has words for the general types or kinds . and in this context the only question is whether the eskimo languages have one word for \\'s now \\' like english or two like ancient greek or whether they only have a variety of more particular words for kinds of snow . alexis\\n',\n",

. our www server is still under development and is changing rapidly , and at the moment there are still several rough spots , but access to all the ippe materials is in place . due to the rich interface provided by the web , browsing the ippe via mosaic ( or any other web browser ) is now the preferred access method . mosaic and other web browsers allow easy access to the multiple formats in which the ippe stores each paper , allowing users to as easily browse an abstract or an ascii version of a paper online as to download or print a fully-formatted version . in addition , we have provided navigation aids such as a colorful graphical map of the ippe ( not to mention the attractive new graphical ippe logo ) . in addition , much of the ippe \\'s structure , and many of our informational documents , are being redesigned to take full advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web . expect further announcements soon . in ncsa mosaic , netscape , lynx , or your www browser of choice , open the url http : / / phil-preprints . l . chiba-u . ac . jp / ippe . html to pay us a visit . new journals online since the last \" news from the ippe \" in july , several more journals have joined our program of making pre-press abstracts , tables of contents , and in some cases selected full-text articles available online . recent additions include ethics and the journal of the history of philosophy , and arrangements are currently being made with five other journals , bringing the total number of journals available or soon to be available through the ippe to over a dozen . we invite the editors of other journals to contact us at the address given below . call for submissions the ippe invites the submission of working papers in all areas of philosophy . submissions undergo an informal process of \" minimal refereeing \" by the ippe \\'s international board to ensure that they are of contemporary philosophical interest , but need not be in fully publishable condition as they stand . due to the flexibility of our electronic media , no length limits apply . the ippe \\'s large collection of working papers is currently being visited by over 1000 philosophers and graduate students each month , providing the widest possible exposure for works in progress . authors benefit from the critical attention of colleagues world-wide . many authors have received incisive commentaries and forged important international connectins with workers in their areas , and the exposure produced by placing a paper on the ippe has also in a number of cases yielded tangible benefits including speaking invitations and offers of publication . copyright to a paper placed on the the ippe remains with the author , and therefore placing a paper on the ippe is no obstacle to subsequent publication . placing a working draft on the ippe provides an ideal way to beenfit from the critical attention of the international philiophical community before submitting a work for publication . call for commentaries the ippe invites the submission of well-reasoned commentaries on any working paper currently available on the ippe . commentaries are subject to the same \" minimal refereeing \" process described above for working papers . accepted commentaries are made available on the ippe alongside the original papers to which they apply , and the authors of the original papers are invited to respond in similar form . ippe represented at psa / 4s / hsa meeting the round table on electronic communications at october \\'s joint meeting of the psa , 4s , and hsa provided an opportunity for members of the ippe \\'s board to meet with representatives of several other leading projects in electronic media for philosophy and science studies . among the topics discussed were means of lowering the technological barriers to access to electronic communications resources , and especially to the submission of materials , and the formation of a consortium or clearinghouse for electronic publishers in these fields . much was accomplished , and even greater possibilities lie ahead . renovations nearly complete the international philosophical preprint exchange \\'s ambitious project to create an integrated system allowing the preprints and other documents on the ippe to be distributed simultaneously by means of the world wide web in addition to the previously implemented gopher , ftp , and mail-server access methods is nearly complete . the customized software we have developed for this purpose allows the ippe staff to easily make a single copy

              " 'subject: sum : native speaker intuitions\\n \\n several weeks ago i posted a question about the current status of \" native speaker intutions \" in our discipline . in particular , i wondered about the problems posed by variations in the interpretation of sentences . such variations sometimes become apparent when i teach \" modern english grammar , \" a course that treats english syntax in nonformal , surface-structure terms and primarily is aimed at nonlinguists . in my post , i mentioned two sentences that gave rise to varying intuitions , but i will discuss in this summary only the first , viz . , \" john asked mary to leave , \" which one student claimed was ambiguous between the reading where mary would do the leaving and that in which john would do the leaving . she claimed she got this second reading by thinking something like \" john asked to leave , \" which clearly means that john would leave , and who he asked was mary . before i continue this discussion , i must point out that in my class i did not solicit interpretations of this sentence , nor did i expect any challenges to my reading , which i essentially presupposed , assuming - - erroneously - - that all my students saw it as i did . perhaps i did not make this point clear in my posting to this list , since several respondents implied that problems will arise when we solicit interpretations or judgments , or indeed if we do \" generative \" grammar at all . however , though my approach to syntax in this course is not generative and i did not request an interpretation for this sentence , students sometimes will challenge my assumptions about meaning . if the students involved were merely contentious , then i would chalk up such differences to personality and continue unabashed . but describing my students as contentious in this case would certainly be a distortion . their observations arose , it seems to me , out of a genuine desire to come to grips with the issue . several respondents pointed out that recent research in syntax has had to deal with the thorny issue of interpretation . georgia green reports that one of her students , tim williams , \" has just completed a dissertation on infinitive complements , and one of the major points is that , as illustrated by the reaction to . . . \\' john asked mary to leave , \\' the subject of the infinitive in so - called equi constructions is not syntactically fixed . ( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) \" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as \" john asked mary to leave \" as meaning \" john asked mary \\'s permission to leave \" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that \" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we \\' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . \" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in \" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , \" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that \" we \\' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . \" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . he contends that these sentences \" are typically interpreted pragmatically taking into account perceived authority ; i . e . , in [ 1 ] the teacher tells the child to leave ; in [ 2 ] the child asks whether s / he can leave . \" in either case , it is likely that it is the child who will be leaving . i should note that this pair of examples proved to be particularly amusing and illuminating to my students - - especially to those who , like me , found the \\' permission \\' reading peculiar . tony \\'s examples demonstrated to them to what extent pragmatic knowledge plays a part in interpretation . the responses to the infinitive problem constituted only one of several lines pursued by my respondents . some , who like me teach undergraduate syntax courses , commented on the difficulty a few students have with even rudimentary syntactic analysis ( e . g . , the subject / predicate split , often claimed to be a universal strategy among english speakers ) . others commented on the familiar problem of intuition fatigue ( which could be summed up as \" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a good string 50 times and it sounds weird \" ) . and still others took issue with the entire enterprise of a separate syntax , particularly of the generative variety , though by now it should be clear that any decontextualized sentence has the potential to give rise to more than one intepretation . in fact this very idea is discussed in carson schutze \\'s forthcoming book , _ the empirical base of linguistics : grammaticality judgments and linguistic methodology _ , to be published by university of chicago press in 1995 . in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data \" can provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . \" finally , one last thread was contributed by larry hutchinson , who mentioned the history of introspection in this century : \" in point of fact , the first psychology labs had been set up by introspectionists , but they were completely taken over by behaviorists and introspection dumped . . . . linguists in the 50 \\'s were pretty much under the sway of behaviorists , and emotionally against introspectionism . . . . but then the enthusiasm generated by chomsky just swept away the behaviorist viewpoint , and along with it the contempt for the unguided use of speaker opinions . \" i thank all of my respondents ( cited below ) for their insightful and helpful remarks . i hope i have not distorted their positions in any serious way . marilyn silva respondents : dan alford , mark arnold , laurie bauer , kirk belnap , tony bex , scott delancey , jakob dempsey , susan ervin - tripp , georgia green , larry hutchinson , ingo plag , jim jewett , jules levin , chris li , steve matthews , dan maxwell , micheal palmer , jeanmarie rouhier , dale russell , mary ellen ryder , carson schutze , linda shockey , jacques steyn , and one respondent who prefers to remain anonymous\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: re : 5 . 1305 qs : canadian american , ipa - fonts for dos , genre analysis ,\\n \\n it may be of general interest to note some differences between canadian and american accents , bearing in mind that both types of accents vary quite a bit , and that what is characteristic of some parts of canada may be characteristic of some parts of the us . for example , one of the most widespread characteristics of canadian english is the merger of short o and long open o , e . g . , hock vs . hawk . although this is also characteristic of certain areas of the us , they are generally not contiguous with the canadian areas of the merger . thus , most of the us border area with canada maintains a distinction . this , then , is a striking contrast , geographically , between canada and the adjacent us at most points . the stereotypical canadian feature , for canadians themselves , and for others who know ( including those who must have handed the canadians their self-stereotype ) is the pronunciation of / aw / as in \" out \" , \" house \" , etc . the nucleus is mid rather than low , so that it sounds something like long o as in \" oat \" as spoken by standard british or philadelphian speakers . commonalities between canada and the adjacent us , similar to the last mentioned feature , is the raising of the nucleus of / ay / as in \" right \" . this seems to keep getting discussed in the context of causing a vowel contrast between \" writer \" and \" rider \" . the canadian and upstate ny contrast has to do with height along the center of vowel space , rather than along the periphery ( central vs . back nucleus ) as in new york city . upstate ny at least , though , seems to be distinct in canada by the more extreme raising of the nucleus of / ay / , and it often sound fronted , as if like a more widespread american / ey / sound , as in \" eight \" . canada is more extreme than the adjacent us in its raising ( from low to mid ) of the / aw / nucleus - the stereotype i discussed above . i have not seen discussion elsewhere of how canadian english deals with short o before r in open syllables . more than most american dialects , it lengthens and raises them to merge with long o , so that \" sorry \" rhymes with \" story \" . this is rare for the words \" sorry \" , \" sorrow \" , \" borrow \" and a few others across us dialects , although it is general in r-ful areas for \" forest \" , \" orange \" and most such words . in this case , the adjacent us dialects , e . g . , northern wisconsin , agree with canada , so that there is a continuum , not the striking border distinction observed for the hock : hawk merger . that \\'s enough , although i welcome observations on other and more localised canadian and border us dialects . as for the british , when they have an american actor and do n\\'t want to make anything out of the fact that he \\'s american in a film , they call him canadian - - in order to explain the accent . apparently they do n\\'t hear the difference - - i guess they only hear flapped t \\'s , but think americans have to be stereotyped as characters , while canadians have more latitude .\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: esl in children cut off from their native language - any insights ?\\n \\n 2 years ago , my wife and i adopted two kids from russia , at the time aged 6 . 5 and 5 . at the time , i informally asked around and got the impression that there was unlikely to be anything particularly interesting linguistically about their experiences in learning english , and was referred to several books on esl / 2nd language learning among immigrants . unfortunately , due to the joys of parenting , i never read most of the references i was given ( i spent the time trying to learn russian instead ) . i recently read something in another adoptive parent \\'s posted experience that made me again wonder about my kids \\' experiences in learning english , which so far have apparently been a little unusual for adoptive kids ( i \\' ll skip the details at this point in my inquiry ) . i am starting to wonder if there is indeed something important in the language experiences of kids adopted into a foreign language environment after infancy . the key difference between international adoptions and other esl situations is that the older adopted kids suddenly are cut off from input in their native language with a certain level of vocabulary and mastery of that language , and thrown into an esl / 2nd language situation where they learn a new language usually with no support in their native language . learning the new language takes a considerable amount of time - my kids could communicate only minimally in english for about a year , but for most adoptive kids , use of the 1st language seems to stop within 1 - 3 months since the kids seem to realize that it no longer serves any useful communicative function . after 2 years , my kids speak what to most people sounds like fluent idiomatic english . however , their vocabulary seems greatly restricted compared to native english kids their age - and their passive vocabulary ( words they understand that they do n\\'t use themselves ) seems to be especially restricted . they also have some peculiarities in grammar and usage - perhaps those typical of second language speakers , but ignored in the adoptive kids since they speak with no trace of an accent . these problems seem to be especially persistent , probably because they pass unnoticed most of the time ( they do show up in the kids \\' writing now ) and they are resistent to correction . my readings in linguistics have thus far all seemed to generalize about a critical period lasting past my kids \\' age , where they are supposed to learn languages like a sponge . the other adoptive parent , however , posted that in talking with esl experts , she found out that \" esl learners generally cannot do phonics in the second language , nor can they follow along in group oral reading . it takes 7 to 11 years in the second language to develop the ability to manipulate written english , particularly abstract cognitive academic material . \" that poster also said that children completely removed from their native language \" before mastering all of its principles \" have especial problems in learning the new language . she also said that many of the normal esl procedures break down in such kids , that there are no good tests for diagnosing language and learning problems in such kids , and that the situation is enough unlike the normal esl situation that trained esl teachers may not recognize problems or know how to solve them . she gave several references , but mostly on the pragmatic \" how to help your kid \" level . but putting on my linguist hat , and reading between the lines , i came up with some questions that i put to the linguistic community : 1 . is anyone reading this doing any research relating to language acquisition in kids cut off from their native tongue in the formative years ? 2 . can anyone provide me references to such work ? 3 . whether i get answers to # 1 or # 2 , what years are the \" formative years \" in which cutting off the child from the native language will have an effect on 2nd language learning ? 4 . does this age range have any relation to the \" critical period \" of language learning ? might there be a correlation that would tell us something about how and why kids learn languages differently and more easily than adults ? 5 . what are the different effects of cutting off a child from his native language at different ages / stages in language formation ? it seems pretty obvious that at the earliest years , \" 2nd language \" learning would asymptotically approach identity with the learning of the first language . 6 . when 1st and 2nd languages have contrasting features , it would seem that these kids would provide especial insight into ug models with parameters , in addition providing some clue as to when and how the parameters are set . has anyone looked at this ? 7 . what is the long-term language prognosis for such kids ? 7 to 11 years of language difficulty , when the difficulty often goes unnoticed ( or at least the fact that the difficulty is due to language problems - the adoptive parent who posted gave a detailed chronicle of her daughter \\'s varying problems from adoption at age 4 until 5th grade when the parent finally came to find out why her daughter was having problems even though she spoke english fluently ) - this seems likely to have severe long-term effects . 8 . my kids and all others i know of have completely lost the native language except for word isolates . do such kids relearn their native language any easier when they get older ? again , looking at contrasting features that such kids have difficulty relearning might tell us a lot about \" parameter setting \" especially when the difficulties do not match those of others acquiring the language as a 2nd langusge with no prior experience in the language . kids cut off from the native language would seem more likely to give clear data on this . 9 . are the effects of being cut-off from one \\'s native language different in kids like mine ? my kids were cut off from the native language only incompletely - they still had each other to talk to , in addition to my wife and my rudimentary self-teaching - but all of this continued exposure to the native language was impoverished both in vocabulary and grammar . ) russian remained the language of our household for most of the kids \\' first year here , and i quickly came to understand the differences in language at differing ages . i could understand and communicate with my kids quite well ( and fluently ) in russian after about a month , but still cannot understand even a slow talking russian adult . the types of errors kids tolerate ( and make - my kids often had the \\' wrong \\' declensional ending on irregular words ) seem quite different from what adults accept . 10 . are there any english language discussions about child language acquisition in russian kids ? ( i \\' m sure there are russian language sources , but i would never get through them . ) i would like to know what the typical russian child at the age my kids were adopted would typically have mastered in features like declensions , numbers , perfective / imperfective distinctions , and proper use of cases - things that i have n\\'t mastered well enough to be able to extract from relistening to tapes thaty i made while they still spoke russian fluently . lojbab lojbab @ access . digex . net bob lechevalier , president , the logical language group , inc . 2904 beau lane , fairfax va 22031-1303 usa 703-385 - 0273 for the artificial language loglan / lojban , see ftp . cs . yale . edu / pub / lojban or see lojban www server : href = \" http : / / xiron . pc . helsinki . fi / lojban / \"\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: summary : in other words\\n \\n dear netters , i have posted several queries a few months ago . about ten members of the linguist list answered me by e-mails . i must show great thanks especially to prof . welchsler , prof . jewett , prof . edwards ( who sent me examples of iow from london - lund corpus ) , prof . patrikis , prof . spackman , prof . macrakis , prof . alvarez - caccamo , prof . harris , prof . huettner , and dr . georgia green ( who introduced me \" two types of convention in indirect speech acts \" by j . l . morgan , contained in the volume : _ syntax and semantics , vol . 9 : pragmatics _ edited by peter cole ( 1978 , new york : academic press ) . the following are my own summary . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in this summary , i propose the hearer \\'s implicature / implication - interpretation process ( prof . alvarez - caccamo \\'s suggestion ) , which constrains on the use of in other words ( iow ) in english . i would distinguish between speaker \\'s intended implicature and hearer \\'s interpreted implicature . thus , speaker a may have the intention to implicate x , but hearer b may very well fail to recognize such impli - cature or else may interpret some other . even if b correctly interprets a \\'s intention , b \\'s interpretation depends largely upon the context and / or background assumption . the use of iow is such a case . a dictionary edited by ball ( 1986 ) calls such usage \" inferential function \" , though he uses the term rather informally in the dictionary . i will follow his terminology just for the sake of convenience . the inferential use of iow frequently occurs between the two people \\'s dialogue . ( 1 ) a : i \\' m afraid there is n\\'t much i can help you with . b : _ in other words _ , you do n\\'t want to be bothered . although the interpretation process of ( 1 ) is very close to what is called \" conventional \" use , i . e . it might be processed spontaneously , without any inferential process in the hearer \\'s mind , b guesses a \\'s real intent , which is not directly inferred from a \\'s utterance , but indirect - ly from a \\'s implicature . in order for b to necessitate iow , b exploits his / her background assumption / encyclopedic knowledge , implicating that a is busy now , or a does n\\'t feel at ease with b . let the implicature just explained be c , then a sequential flow of consciousness / inferential process such as a $ @ \" * ( jc $ @ \" * ( jb emerges . iow is a visible index of the hearer \\'s implicature-interpretation process . speaker / hearer \\'s background assumption varies between common sense and the knowledge which is only valid between the speaker and hearer . ( 2 ) a : i love schubert \\'s late piano sonatas . b : _ in other words _ , you do n\\'t like the beethoven sonatas ? iow in ( 2b ) is derived by the use of a restricted set of background assumption in which b has already admired the beethoven sonatas . b assumes that a is also an admirer of beethoven , but contrary to b \\'s assumption a declares an admiration for schubert . so , b feels criticism in a \\'s words . b \\'s background assumption becomes an old information , conflates a \\'s new information and enables iow to create a = b . \" non - conventional \" , rather complicated use of iow is the following . ( 3 ) a : i \\' m going to kill you . b : _ in other words _ , you \\'d like it if i moved my car . for example , b \\'s car stands in the way of a \\'s car , so that a gets infuriated at b . the situation like the above gets a to utter such harsh words ; kill you . a \\'s real intent , in this case implicature / implication , is \" i \\' m going to kill you if you do n\\'t move your car \" , or simply \" move your car \" , which is labelled as c again . b , beginning with iow , paraphrases c by b \\'s own words . again in order for b to use iow , h / she must infer that a assumes / implicates c . background assumption mitigates b \\'s processing effort . if not , b processes too much effort and cannot interpret a \\'s words . b \\'s job here is to process the flow of the dialogue like a $ @ \" * ( jc $ @ ! a ( jb . b \\'s failure to process / infer the flow of the dialogue sometimes occurs . ( 1 \\' ) a : i \\' m afraid there is n\\'t much i can help you with . b \\' : ? _ in other words _ , you need to be helped . in the context where a really needs help , s / he does n\\'t bother to say that s / he can\\'t help b \\' . if a \\'s hands are full of the parcels and he visibly needs help , so that s / he says s / he can\\'t help b \\' , there is a possibility of b \\' saying it is you who need to be helped . however , this is a very insulting comment , because b \\' actually implies that if you can\\'t help me , you are not a capable person . so , you are the one who needs help . another completely misled example of inference is the following . ( 4 ) a : sorry , i can\\'t help you now , because i \\' m busy . b : * _ in other words _ , you \\' re busy . unacceptability of b comes from a \\'s words _ because i \\' m busy _ , where a has already spoken out his own implicature c . mere repetition cannot be allowed in iow \\'s case . if something extra can be implied in b \\'s response , type of ( 4 ) is ok . ( 5 ) a : sorry , i can\\'t help you now . b : _ in other words _ , you can\\'t . ( - ) \\' you really can\\'t . \\' ) in summary , an utterance \" a . in other words , b \" has an inferential process / hearer \\'s interpretive process \" a $ @ \" * ( jc ; in other words c $ @ ! a ( jb \" . iow can be campared with \\'s o \\' and \\' then , \\' etc . the following results are the above contributors \\' reactions .

( \" ) . re-editing , adding and deleting labels labels can be re-edited , new labels can be added anywhere in the signal , and labels can be deleted individually or for an entire signal . reproduce labeled segment while the label is open for editing , you can play the selected portion of the signal by doing command - y . if you \\' re labeling a selection , and if you \\' ve set the audio to play signal selections , you \\' ll hear the segment which you \\' re about to label . align labels you can choose any of nine different vertical positions for placing labels . when you close a label with a click in the close rectangle or with return , the label automatically \" snaps \" to the nearest standard position . save labels the label information is saved as a tab - delimited text file with the extension \" . lbl \" . it is stored in the same folder as the signal file . label format the label format is in the public domain and is fully documented . it is available on the signalyze servers ( see below ) . transparent saving and opening open file operations on signal files that have accompanying \" . lbl \" text files cause the label information to be read into signalyze . save file operations on signals with labeling information automatically saves the labels in the same folder as the signal . save file operations for signals without labeling information erases whatever label file may have existed in the folder . label in phonetics you can use any phonetic or normal font in the labels . however for phonetics , it is recommended stick to sigpalfont ( the shareware font supplied with signalyze ) . sigpalfont preserves the numbers and angular brackets you need to indicate labeling levels , which is usually not possible with other phonetic fonts . search by label or by level you can search for labels using either a given labeling level or the label \\'s name . you can specify two separate search patterns . switch between the two patterns with the shift-lock key . more info and demo information on signalyze version 3 . 0 is available as follows : by ftp : ftp macfl4082 . unil . ch or ftp 130 . 223 . 104 . 31 login anonymous by gopher server : name of machine : gopher . unil . ch , find \" europe \" and \" switzerland \" , select \" university of lausanne \" , select \" autres gophers de l3unil \" , select \" faculte des lettres \" , select \" laboratoire d3analyse informatique de la parole ( laip ) \" , select \" speech analysis and speech synthesis \" , select \" signalyze \" prof . eric keller ( new email address : eric . keller @ imm . unil . ch ) laboratoire d \\' analyse / / ^ | | | | = = \\\\ \\\\ informatique de la parole ( laip ) / / / \\\\ | | | | | | lettres , universite de lausanne / / / / \\\\ \\\\ | | | | = = / / ch-1015 lausanne , switzerland / / / / = = = \\\\ \\\\ | | | | fax + 41 21 6924639 / + 41 21 692 4510 / / = = = = / / \\\\ \\\\ | | | | \" . 6 . ucla - uppsala analysis package ( to run on macrecorder files ) \" write to : software manager , phonetics lab , linguistics dept , ucla , los angeles , ca 90024-1543 for our order form . it \\'s $ 5 for just this disk . \" ( peter ladefoged ) 7 . gw instruments soundscope ( formerly macspeechlab ii ) ( mac ) \" more able to be tailored to individual uses than csl , but also a little clumsier and slower than csl . i think it runs about $ 3000 . \" ( alex francis ) c ) for unix 1 . xwaves + it costs around $ 5000 and the manufacturer is : \" entropic research laboratory , inc . 600 pennsylvania ave . , se washington dc 20003 usa \" ( franke ingolf ) 2 . dsp ( it has the same specifications with the sfs that has been presented above , about dos / windows ) . 3 . sfs ( it has the same specifications with the sfs that has been presented above , about dos / windows ) . 4 . digital ears no more information , only the name of the manufacturer , i . e . metaresearch 5 . ogi speech \" this is free ! ! ! i have never used it professionally , but while working at los alamos nat \\' l . labs i did get a chance to play with it . it comes with a good manual , and works with a number of different sound-file types , and can be configured for a number of different platforms ( sun & sgi ) . . . . it needs some additional hardware . \" ( alex francis ) . 6 . entropic sps software that runs through the xwaves + package . i do not know its prise ; also , i did not understand if it is a latest software improvement of xwaves + . \" address : entropic research laboratory , inc . 600 pennsylvania ave . , se washington dc 20003 usa \" ( franke ingolf ) additional information : read , buder & kent .

( the data for the english list is , apart from some editing , taken from tony woodbury \\'s posting ( see vol-5 - 1239 ) ) . granted not everything white in the listings given is snow , how can we comment on the quotation above ? at least , the writer should have told the reader why so many snowy words of english do not count as snow , or , perhaps , that eskimo in his opinion has no cover term , where english does have one . as it stands , however , it should make everybody very cautious about obtaining data of any language - - - including , obviously , their own - - - by way of secondary sources . likewise , how much do the manymany ` facts \\' drawn from ` exotic \\' ( i . e . , not very well documented ) languages count , which , for example , phonologists like to decorate their elaborate articles with ? two , i do n\\'t really get the point in excluding words like cornice from a snowy list . now if there are people out there who use the word primarily to denote some sort of snow formation and feel the word is in its * architectural * meaning of rather metaphorical nature , what \\'s the point in telling them they \\' re ` really \\' wrong ? in german , waechte , flocke and harsch might very well be derived from some other morphemes . in fact , this only tells us eskimo is not very well documented . i guess a lot of those words the hoax claims as semantically primitive would turn out much more connected to the rest of the vocabulary had we only the relative wealth of historical data we have for the indoeuropean languages . back to german again , flocke to me primarily denotes not ` something flaky \\' but rather precisely ` a snowflake \\' , and all other usages seem to be derived from that . harsch seems to be connected with harsch ` harsh \\' ; but used as a noun , what other denotation but that kind of slighly melted and frozen snow does it have ? loipe is the kind of tracks skiers use in their discipline and , i guess , not a ` very german \\' word - - - but disregarding borrowed words is just as silly as looking down on adopted children . anyway , there seems to be a need for that word . it \\'s snowy , very specialized , and , for my feeling , totally unconnected with any other word in german . of course i might be totally wrong ( and loipe is derived from ( ski ) laufen ` to run ( to ski ) \\' ) . now there \\'s the point . linguists are looking , on the one hand , into history to find out what really happened and try to extrapolate people \\'s minds to describe what \\'s really going on . if there \\'s someone with a lot of waechten and cornices and flakes on his mind , but with no connection to other non-snowy words for him , this is a fact of that ideolect . of course , as soon some linguist comes along and tells him the historical truth , behaviour and concepts of the speaker might change . . . even if in fact it was some sort of folk-etymology he absorbed when listening to the linguist : - ) . folk - etymology is there because it is a way we can imagine things to be . . . so , what layer of this person \\'s brain is it that synchronic word counting is claiming to acount for , and how historical a derivation is allowed or necessary in historical linguistics ? finally , i would like to point out that apart from some pretty specialized words having to do woth snow , rain is another phenomenon languages may have more or less to say about . in german , for example , you have niesel and nieselregen , denoting a very light rain or spray . there seem to be no other uses or compounds for this word apart from es nieselt , however , and no immediately related , more basic word niesel could be said to be derived from . so , we have wasser , regen , niesel , and more . eskimo does n\\'t appear that much outlandish any more , does it ? quotation taken from : trudgill , peter : _ sociolinguistics : an introduction _ . penguin books . 1974 wolfgang lipp castor @ fub46 . zedat . fu-berlin . de i52023 @ sakura . kudpc . kyoto-u . ac . jp\\n',\n",

\\' hold \\' can also be used to a large extent for \\' possess \\' , but not for \\' existence \\' or \\' compulsion \\' also , an anonymous reply pointed out another construction for \\' possess \\' with aru - \\' exist \\' , but was not sure about the difference in meaning between \\' possess \\' with mot - and \\' possess \\' with aru . basque : * edun ( nowadays - du - ) is used for possession and as an auxiliary . in addition , in the south , the verb eduki \\' hold \\' has also to some extent been grammaticalized to denote \\' possess \\' and also \\' perfect \\' with transitive verbs , while intransitives form the perfect with izan \\' be \\' . this development seems to be following the lines of the development latin ) romance . hebrew : there is no verb \\' possess \\' in hebrew : possession is expressed periphrastically ( with the \" dative \" ) . interestingly , here also there is a connection between \\' possess \\' and \\' compulsion \\' and \\' existence \\' , which all apparently use this construction . aramaic : in many aramaic dialects , the earlier construction \\' past participle + dative ( \\' l \\' ) + pronoun \\' became the past tense . l is now predominantly used for a goal with verbs of motion , but is also used for possession . arabic : in cairene colloquial arabic , @ anda \\' at / near / by \\' is used for possession and is then negated like a verb , not like a preposition . tamil iru \\' be ( located ) \\' + dative is used for possession and for durative / continuous aspect , but not for perfect / perfective . kol \\' hold \\' , although not used for \\' possess \\' can be combined with iru and denotes that the action is one of the following : self-benefactive , reflexive , deliberate and / or accidental ( depending on what was expected ) . crow : \\' exist \\' / \\' not-exist \\' is not only used for existence but also \\' possess \\' and perfective aspect . finish : pitaa \\' hold \\' can also be used to express \\' compulsion \\' but interestingly , not \\' possess \\' . dakota : yuha \\' hold \\' may also be used to some extent for \\' have \\' , otherwise \\' be with \\' is used . chinese : yong3yiu3 , where yong3 denotes \\' embrace \\' , can also be used to express \\' possess , own \\' . to stress that one has total control , one may use zhung3yiu3 , where zhung3 denotes \\' hold in one \\'s palm \\' ( yiu3 is \\' possess \\' , \\' existence \\' and can also be used for \\' perfect \\' with questions and negative statements ) idg * ghebh \\' give \\' -

              " 'subject: summary of \\' bubbler \\'\\n \\n a few months ago i posted an inquiry on the linguist listing on the distribution of the word \" bubbler \" as a synonym for drinking fountain . thanks to all who responded , which are too many to list . the dictionary of american regional english has also extensively investigated this word and it was my goal to gain more specific information than that supplied by dare ( for example , the regional distribution within wisconsin . ) here is a summary of my findings : in wisconsin , bubbler is used throughout the eastern half of the state , particularly along the coast of lake michigan and becomes less prominent the further west one travels . the \" stronghold \" of bubbler appears to be in milwaukee and its suburbs . milwaukee is also thought to be the geographic origin of bubbler , coined by the kohler company in the early 1900 \\'s . my university ( uw - whitewater ) appears to be in conflict over what to call drinking fountains . in one of our residence halls there is a sign asking residents to not use the drinking fountain as a garbage disposal . the word \\'d rinking \\' is crossed out , and \\' water \\' is put in its place . then \\' water \\' and \\' fountain \\' are crossed out , and \\' bubbler \\' is put in their place . it goes to show you that people can be very loyal to their colloquialisms ! my research provided no evidence for the term \\'s use in minnesota or illinois , but i did find the word in use along the western part of michigan \\'s upper peninsula ( which borders wisconsin \\'s bubbler-using region . ) if bubbler is used anywhere else in the midwest , its existence escaped my research . in fact , i found no evidence of the word \\'s use within the u . s . west of the mississippi or south of the ohio river . the other region that uses the term includes the state of rhode island ( where it is used exclusively by many speakers ) , far eastern connecticut , and southeastern massachusetts - including the boston area . i had people from this region respond with amusement because they did n\\'t know the word was used anywhere outside of their area . lastly , and much to my surprise , bubbler is used in southeastern australia - predominately in new south wales ( including sydney and canberra ) and in portions of the provinces bordering new south wales . the information on australia is only based on a few responses , but there were some , especially in sydney , who used bubbler exclusively while growing up . there were some from parts of australia who had never heard the term before , so it does appear that it is also regionally distributed in australia . there were some who distinguished bubblers from drinking fountains . some only called outside fountains , bubblers , while others vice versa . one only called non-refridgerating fountains , bubblers . drinking fountain seems to be the generic term that everyone is familiar with , whether they use it or not . other synonymns are : water fountain , water cooler , fountain , and water bubbler . for what its worth , the only accounts i had of the term \\' water bubbler \\' were among african americans from milwaukee ( but this only included three people . ) just plain \\' fountain \\' seemed to be the word of choice in northwestern wisconsin , while drinking fountain and water fountain were used pretty interchangeably everywhere else . as for its use in literature , the only printed documentation of bubbler i could find ( under the given definition ) was a 1985 milwaukee journal article which was about the word \\'s usage in milwaukee . i realize that some of my findings are inconsistent with dare - i believe this is because my research was not nearly as thorough as dare , and did n\\'t take into account historical usage , only current usage . thanks again to those who responded . your avid bubbler user , sean christensen internet : seanc @ iclnet93 . iclnet . org university of wisconsin - whitewater\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: comparative method in syntax\\n \\n fritz newmeyer asks if it is legitimate to apply the comparative method in syntax . my answer is yes , but it is more difficult . the main reason why one sees more work on historical-comparative syntax than fifty years ago is that syntax has become much more prestigious in recent decades . i do n\\'t think that there was a shift from a once \" standard \" view that syntactic reconstruction is impossible . bernhard delbrueck \\'s historical-comparative syntax of indo - european , published a hundred years ago , clearly showed that comparative syntax is both possible and fruitful , but perhaps too difficult to attract many followers . the view that historical-comparative syntax is impossible was defended in some detail in lightfoot \\'s ( 1979 ) principles of diachronic syntax , but few researchers seem to have been discouraged by lightfoot \\'s attitude . it is true that latin syntax could hardly be reconstructed from modern romance languages , but neither could latin morphology , and even the view of latin phonology that we would get from romance is very distorted . our reconstruction of protolanguage grammar is always imperfect , but that is no reason not to attempt reconstruction . the main error on lightfoot \\'s side is that there is no syntactic analog to the regularity of sound change . it \\'s just a bit more complicated in syntax - - just like syntax is more complicated overall than phonology . basically , the analog to phonemes and words are words and sentences . true , the difference between words and sentences is that in general sentences are not stored in the lexicon . but neither are many complex words ( rendering morphological reconstruction similarly difficult , but nobody seems ever to have objected to morphological reconstruction ) , and some sentences are actually stored , e . g . proverbs and idioms , which often show syntactic archaisms . and since earlier syntax often survives in \" fossilized \" form in later morphology , we have another rich source of data for diachronic syntax . in addition to regularity of change , we need general principles of change for plausible reconstruction , e . g . phonological principles that predict likely changes like assimilation , lenition , segment loss , etc . in syntax , similar principles of change exist as well : spatial nouns become spatial adpositions , certain general verbs become tense and aspect markers , allative case markers become dative case markers , purposive verb forms become infinitives , etc . all these processes ( instances of grammaticalization ) are irreversible changes and provide safe guides for linguists seeking to make sense of daughter language diversity by reconstructing a proto-syntax . the massive regularities of grammaticalization are generally ignored in generative studies of syntactic change ( indeed , lightfoot argues that there are no genuine principles of diachronic syntax ) , but if one takes them into account , they help in the difficult task of reconstruction . martin haspelmath ( free university of berlin )\\n',\n",
              " \"subject: re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ?\\n \\n theoretically , there is no reason why the comparative method could not be applied to syntactic properties . however , there are two practical , very great , impediments : 1 . syntax dealing with word order , what is word order ? and further which word order in which environments ? e . g . : ich verstehe sie . ploetzlich verstehe ich sie . ( subordinating conjunction ) ich sie verstehe . un grand homme . un homme grand . ma chemise propre . ma propre chemise . 2 . how do we measure the difference ? how far is svo from sov ? from vso ? not only we do not know how to describe syntactic properties satisfactorily , but we do not know how to measure their differences , or , it boils down to the same , their similarities . now , you can validly argue that a binary scale ( same , different , and no shades of grey in between ) is good enough . remains that you do not reach valid comparisons on the basis of a single feature , but of many . if languages x and y have n identical features out of n , we are tempted to say that their syntactic similarity is n / n . but that is true if and only if each feature has the same weighting . on top of that , we do not even know what constitutes * one * feature . for instance , we may consider svo as consisting of two to three features : 1 . relative order of subject and verb 2 . relative order of verb and object 3 . relative order of subject and object where necessary to disambiguate . and further , how do we specify free sv order for instance ? via a ternary relation ( precede , follow , free ) , thus order = ( free , s , v ) or a binary relation ( precede , follow ) and a union , thus order = ( precede , s , v ) + ( follow , s , v ) ? too many questions unanswered , i fear even unaddressed . too many questions issuing from them . we cannot , i think , found a proper methodology on such shaky grounds . we 'd better be content with arguing futilely until we are blue in the keyboard . or else set about tackling those questions , a daunting task . j . guy @ trl . oz . au\\n\",\n",

[ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as \" a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords \" ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of \" stage whispered \" speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a \" shouted \" whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that \" in languages such as english \" ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it \\'s rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com\\n',\n",

( a ) for many language families , there is no other basis for classification available , because they lack the kind of morphological complexity so beloved of indo - europeanists , algonkianists , and those other - ists who happen to enjoy its blessings in \" their \" languages , ( b ) the danger of confusing borrowings for cognates is always real , but it is easy to see that the lexical connaections of english with french are more transparent phonologically and less central semantically than those with dutch , hence more recent , hence borrowings . ( c ) there is nothing novel in what i am saying , since it is the method which , for example , edward sapir used to establish that the uto - aztecan languages are really a family ( rather than three families ) . ( d ) you cannot possibly realistically expect normal people to spend time writing comparative grammars of languages which have not previously been shown to be related . so classification must come first ! on the other hand , it is perfectly easy to write a \" crazy \" comparative grammar for any random group of languages , e . g . , french and english . the last is perhaps the most important point : reconstruction of morphological systems can be done well or badly , so can comparison of lexical items . both can yield correct results ; both can also produce garbage . p . s . i say \\' lexical items \\' deliberately , because there seem to be language families where there is no morphology at all to compare . in most cases , howveer , there are some bound morphemes , and one compares those as well ( as did sapir in the case of uto - aztecan ) . but this is a far cry from reconstructing the kind of intricate morphological patterns found in the older indo - european languages , for example , but absent from many other language families .\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: books and articles on cd-rom\\n \\n this text is also available in german ( see below ) dear linguist readers throughout the last years the working conditions of many scientists have been profoundly changed through the introduction of modern data processing technology . almost every workplace is being equipped with a computer which , after hours or even days of patiently getting acquainted with the working procedure of these tools , constitutes an enormous advantage . this advantage especially shows in the ever more efficient saving , processing , and transferring of data . thus , as early as today , most of the manuscripts of books , articles , diplomas , and master \\'s theses are being processed through word processing programmes and are eventually available as a computer file . besides word processing , both newer , more rapid processors and more efficient programmes also make possible an ever higher integration of images , image sequences and sound recordings into a written text . accordingly , a phonetic transcription of an experiment can contain , in addition to the text , not only a recording of the language but also photographs of the articulating organs , such as mouth and upper jaw . that allows the experiment to be followed much more easily and also to be conducted by other scientists from a different view point . in addition to saving how the research work is done , it is also possible to save the subject of the research on any kind of storage media . in order to archive the amount of data resulting from this particular combination of text , sound and images , the compact disc ( cd ) has come more and more into fashion as the perfect storage medium . today , many publications are already available on cd . besides the possibility of a multi-media presentation of knowledge , the cd has one more advantage : because of the low production costs of a cd and its huge storage capacity , more publications of scientists can be made available than is currently possible in journals and books . at this point , the possibility emerges for young scientists as well as for renowned ones to publish their works that have up to now tended to disappear in some drawer because of either the publishing costs or a \" not-a - chance \" notion . with this as a background , i would like to begin a survey to determine to what extent the linguists of all fields might have interest in the following questions : 1 . ) is multi-media technology commonly accepted ? do linguists prefer traditional print media , or is there any interest in accepting knowledge from the computer screen ? 2 . ) is there any interest in publishing works which contain not only text but also images and sound ? what ideas are there on how to publish these scientific works ? 3 . ) who has experience using cds in the field of linguistics ? this survey is intended to serve as a basis for developing a concept for a new enterprise in the media services sector , which should provide next year \\'s young linguistically oriented post-graduate students a platform from which to work independently . i would like to thank you in advance for your answers and ideas . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ liebe linguist leser , in den letzten jahren hat sich die arbeitswelt vieler wissenschaftler durch die einfuehrung moderner techniken der datenverarbeitung grundlegend geaendert . fast jeder arbeitsplatz ist mit einem computer ausgestattet , der nach einigen geduldigen stunden und tagen des kennenlernens der wirkungsweise dieser geraete , einen enormen arbeitsvorteil darstellt . dieser vorteil besteht insbesondere in der mehr und mehr komfortableren erfassung , verarbeitung und weitergabe von daten . so werden die meisten niederschriften von buechern , artikeln , diplom - und magisterarbeiten bereits heute durch textverarbeitungsprogramme bearbeitet und liegen letztendlich als eine datei vor . neue und schnellere rechner sowie leistungsfaehigere programme machen neben der bearbeitung von text auch mehr und mehr eine integration von bildern , bildsequenzen und tonaufnahmen in eine niederschrift moeglich . so kann z . b . eine phonetische niederschrift ueber ein lautsprachliches experiment neben den schriftlichen ausfuehrungen auch die sprachaufnahmen enthalten , aber auch bildaufnahmen der artikulierenden organe , wie mund und unterkiefer ; damit ist dieses experiment besser nachvollziehbar und koennte unter anderen gesichtspunkten von dritten wissenschaftlern ebenfalls durchgefuehrt werden . es ist also moeglich , in vielen faellen neben den ausfuehrungen einer untersuchung , auch den untersuchungsgegenstand auf einen datentraeger zu speichern . um diese mengen an daten , die durch die kombination von text , bild und ton entstehen , zu archivieren , bewaehrt sich immer mehr die cd als speichermedium . viele veroeffentlichungen erscheinen schon heute auf cd . neben der moeglichkeit einer multi - media darstellung von wissen , hat die cd aber noch einen weiteren vorteil : aufgrund der niedrigen herstellungskosten einer cd und der riesigen menge an speicherplatz wird es moeglich , publikationen von mehr wissenschaftlern zu veroeffentlichen , als es mit herkoemmlichen journalen und buechern moeglich ist . hier ergibt sich fuer junge wissenschaftler , aber auch fuer renommierte die moeglichkeit , ihre niederschriften an die oeffentlichkeit zu bringen , die bisher , bedingt durch preis und ` chancenlosigkeit \\' , eher in der schublade verschwanden . mit diesem hintergrund versehen , wuerde ich gern eine umfrage starten , inwieweit linguisten aller gebiete ein interesse an folgenden themen zeigen : 1 . ) gibt es eine allgemeine akzeptanz der multi - media technik . greifen linguisten lieber auf traditionell gedruckte literatur zurueck , oder besteht auch ein interesse an der wissensaufnahme durch den bildschirm . 2 . ) interessiert sich jemand fuer eine veroeffentlichung eigener arbeiten , die neben text auch bild und ton enthalten . welche vorstellungen gibt es ueber eine solche art und weise der publikation von wissenschaftlichen arbeiten . 3 . ) wer hat schon erfahrungen in der sprachwissenschaftlichen anwendung von cd \\'s gesammelt ? diese umfrage steht in dienst einer konzeptentwicklung fuer ein neues unternehmen im medien - dienstleistungsbereich , das fuer jungen , sprachwissenschaftlich orientierten studenten nach abschluss des studiums im naechsten jahr die basis fuer eine eigenstaendige arbeiten bilden soll . bereits im voraus bedanke ich mich fuer ihre antworten und anregungen . ingolf franke zeughausstrasse 31 d-54292 trier germany tel .

              " 'subject: aaai fall symoposium on formalizing context\\n \\n formalizing context aaai-95 fall symposium mit , cambridge , massachusetts november 10-12 , 1995 call for papers description the notion of context has played an important role in ai systems for many years . however , formal logical explication of contexts remains an area of research in which there are significant open issues . this symposium will provide a forum for discussing formalizations of contexts , approaches to resolving open issues , and application areas for context formalisms . the most ambitious goal of formalizing contexts is to make automated reasoning systems which are never permanently stuck with the concepts they use at a given time because they can always transcend the context they are in . such a capability would allow the designer of a reasoning system to include only such phenomena as are required for the system \\'s immediate purpose , retaining the assurance that if a broader system is required later , \" lifting rules \" can be devised to restate the facts from the narrow context in the broader context with qualifications added as necessary . a formal theory of context in which sentences are always considered as asserted within a context could provide a basis for such transcendence . formal theories of context are also needed to provide a representation of the context associated with a particular circumstance , e . g . the context of a conversation in which terms have particular meanings that they would n\\'t have in the language in general . linguists and philosophers have already studied similar notions of context . an example is the situation theory that has been proposed in philosophy and applied to linguistics . however , these theories usually lie embedded in the analysis of specific linguistic constructions , so locating the exact match with ai concerns is itself a research challenge . this symposium aims to bring together researchers who have studied or applied contexts in ai or related fields . technical papers dealing with formalizations of context , the problem of generality , and use of context in common sense reasoning are especially welcome . however , survey papers which focus on contexts from other points of view , such as philosophy , linguistics , or natural language processing , or which apply contexts in other areas of ai , are also encouraged . submission information persons wishing to make presentations at the workshop should submit papers ( up to 12 pages , 12pt font ) . persons wishing only to attend the workshop should submit a 1 - 2 page research summary including a list of relevant publications . a postscript file or 8 paper copies should be sent to the program chair . limited funding will be available to support student travel . timetable april 14 , 1995 submission deadline . may 19 , 1995 submitters will be informed of decisions august 15 , 1995 final papers due september 20 , 1995 aaai will mail working notes to the participants november 10-12 , 1995 fall symposium program committee sasa buvac ( chair ) . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . buvac @ sail . stanford . edu richard fikes . knowledge systems laboratory , stanford university , 701 welch road , bldg . c , palo alto , ca 94304 . fikes @ ksl . stanford . edu ramanathan guha . mcc , 3500 , w . balcones center drive , austin , tx 78759 . guha @ mcc . com pat hayes . beckman institute , 405 north mathews av . , urbana , il 61801 . phayes @ cs . uiuc . edu john mccarthy . department of computer science , stanford university , stanford ca 94305-2140 . jmc @ sail . stanford . edu murray shanahan . imperial college , dept of computing , 180 queen \\'s gate , london sw7 2bz , england . mps @ doc . ic . ac . uk robert stalnaker . 20d-220 , department of linguistics and philosophy , m . i . t . cambridge , ma 02139 . stal @ mit . edu johan van benthem . institute for logic , language and computation , university of amsterdam , plantage muidergracht 24 , 1018 tv amsterdam , the netherlands . johan @ fwi . uva . nl ( postscript and plain text versions of this announcement are available through the symposium www page at http : / / sail . stanford . edu / buvac / 95 - context-symposium and via anonymous ftp from sail . stanford . edu in the directory / buvac / 95 - context-symposium . )\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: re : 5 . 1433 comparative method\\n \\n i re-read newmeyer \\'s original posting ( date 30 nov 94 ) and noticed that it has an implicit attack on the notion of \" basic word order \" for comparative purposes . this flows from his earlier question on how basic word order is variously defined by various analysts , implying that it lacks precision . to the extent that i have understood the responses so far , no one has responded to this particular point , so here goes - - basically in agreement with newmeyer , but with some criticism of the assumed larger implications for comparative reconstruction of syntax . i \\' ll stick to what i know about linguistic events in europe since i expect the events to be more familiar to most readers than events in other language families , so that my examples may speak to readers \\' previous ideas about particular linguistic events referred to below , and , under the best circumstances , provoke further discussion . to anticipate , the notion of basic word order is too simple-minded ( simplistic ? ) for diachronic purposes . fn : \" could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? \" bw : should it ? the immediate ancestor of the romance languages is not latin but proto - romance . svo ? what about the exceptions , e . g . , french j \\' ai rien fait etc . are n\\'t they hints to certain historical complications . also aux inversion in standard french , e . g . , sont-ils venus ? standard french aux inversion is probably of germanic origin , not found elsewhere in romance . as for reconstruction of case ( cf . latin / english ) , with possible implications for earlier word order possibilities , case inflections remain on ( third person ) object clitics in all romance languages . when we consider deviations from svo word order in romance languages , we may suspect that the notion of \" basic \" word order is a villain to the extent that it invites the analyst to disregard less frequent or syntactically restricted word orders . this is not safe in internal reconstruction of syntax , while the most revealing procedure may be to do internal reconstruction of syntax within a language before using the comparative method to reconstruct within groups of languages genetically related by other criteria . in fact , the last point above is what is usually done , and is probably the only proper way to proceed , given the intent of the comparative method . always reconstruct a basic vocabulary first , on the basis of sound correspondences - - to justify genetic relationship among the languages . then consider syntactic comparison . problems with this necessary procedure will emerge in following discussion , but it remains necessary unless you want to reconstruct the syntactic evolution of a geographical area rather than of a genetic family . the latter may be a useful complement to assumed genetic reconstruction , but i think it is too digressive an idea for me to pursue below . now , what about preverbal object clitics in romance ? another hint of complications to the svo concept of romance . preverbal object clitic means ov - - but i suppose \" basic \" means when o has a noun not a pronoun as the head . and what aout the fixing of multiple object clitic order in romance ? e . g . , case order versus person ( inherent topicality ) order . that can\\'t be reconstructed for latin because the clitics did not arise as distinct entities until proto - romance at the earliest . can a single or preferred clitic order be reconstructed for proto - romance , e . g . , dat-acc ( invariant in spanish and , i think , rumanian , but acc-dat seems to be older in french , now remaining only for third persons , i . e . , no inherent topicality difference therefore earlier case ordering remains - - french acc-dat may reflect germanic influence as well ? ) ? or did fixed clitic orders originally arise independently in various areas of romance ? in any case , how can we avoid the comparative method in addressing the problem of the origin of object clitic order in romance ? in sum , i think that the origin / s and evolution of fixed multiple object clitic orders in romance is a legitimate issue , and that it cannot be solved without recourse to the comparative method ( among others , of course ) . therefore , the comparative method cannot be dismissed in syntactic reconstruction . fn : \" should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? \" bw : newmeyer \\'s reference to proto - germanic reveals even more than romance that \" basic \" word order is a villainous concept for reconstruction in this case , as if \" basic \" word orders can be compared across related languages to reconstruct \" proto-basic \" word orders , such that \" minor \" word orders can be ignored or reconstructed as \" proto-minor \" word orders . one principle which emerges from our knowledge of the historical record is that word order change does n\\'t work that way , i . e . , word orders cannot be compartmentalized as \" basic \" and \" minor \" for diachronic purposes . principle : if we want to develop tools and principles for syntactic reconstruction , we will really have to consider the functions served by the various word orders at different times , and detect changes in their functions diachronically . in other words , word order change in a language must be studied in the context of the totality of functions of all its word orders at any given time . the difference between such a study and the study of change in \" basic \" word order , if the latter means anything at all , is analogous to the study of phonetic change and phonemic change . if analysts argue about the notion of \" basic \" word order , this is analogous to arguing about different concepts of the phoneme , and not about agreed upon linguistic facts . the fallacy of reconstructing \" basic \" word order for proto - germanic on the basis of the \" basic \" word order in current germanic becomes obvious according to the above principle because of the sov word order in subordinate clauses in continental germanic . and even this is not as invariant a property of the oldest texts as it is of the later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german and dutch . english also clues us in to inversion by its many remnants , even without historical texts which reveal more similarities to continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following a subordinate clause or adverb , still common in the av bible . including english but excluding gothic which mirrors to the extent possible the new testament greek syntax from which it was translated , the earliest texts in germanic show , as far as i know , a tendency relatively favorable to verb-final in subordinate clauses , but much variation , later eliminated in the continental standards . this leads to arguments about whether or not the sov tendency was the break-up of an earlier more general indo - european sov tendency ( or earlier fixation ? ) which died in english and scandinavian ( including the still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even for simplistic functional arguments for the evolution of svo in germanic , so that the argument would have to be : it started as a reaction to the increasing unreliability of case distinction but spread for social reasons to languages that did n\\'t need it . such an argument does not strike me as at all unreasonable ! ) . [ although i excluded gothic above , because of its malleable accommodation to greek syntax , its deviations from nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is the absence of a definite article , despite its occurrence in nt greek as well as in all other germanic languages . if gothic translation was totally serious about imitating nt greek syntax in all cases it could have adopted an unstressed demonstrative to imitate the greek article , as later germanic did ( in a sense ) . the most important question about gothic syntax is : is the malleability of its syntax innovative from proto - germanic ? - - if so , we will probably never know in what ways the gothic translations of nt greek stretched the limits of that malleability , and distorted the colloquial functions of word order in spoken gothic or more generally in the germanic of the third century . if sov was invariant in some ancestor , then why did it deteriorate in germanic ? at least as puzzling , how / why / when did germanic get aux inversion , even in yes / no questions . all indo - european languages show wh fronting for wh questions , so is there any reason to believe the proto - language did not . would i be buying what newmeyer is questioning with the preceding argument , cf . fn : \" i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : \" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . \" \" bw : [ why with \" increasing frequency \" ? is the implication that copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible than they used to be ( cf . the discussion of the spread of rumors about the number of eskimo words for snow ) , or that syntax is driving historical linguistics to pot ? ] to be safe , i guess ancillary arguments come in , like : considering how areally widespread the ie languages are , is it likely that the unanimity of wh first questions across ie is not reflective of the proto-language ? ok , so maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got a better explanation for the facts ? or reason to ignore them ? ) , but why aux inversion in germanic questions . and does the application of inversion to yes / no questions mean that there was a question marker in initial position ( wh question position ) with yes / no questions , as in \" what / hullo , are you kidding me ? \" ( such a marker \" ibai \" is found in gothic whenever the new testament greek original has \" me : \" ) . do n\\'t get me wrong . i \\' m not suggesting that an initial yes / no question-marker was a necessary condition for the inversion innovation in germanic . i \\' m only observing that there was the option of such a marker , and anticipating ( if indeed it has not already been suggested ) that some analysts who are overly formal in their approaches to syntax might suppose the necessity of such a marker to motivate a mechanical generalisation of inversion from wh to yes / no questions . again , because such in - version occurs in all germanic should we not reconstruct it for proto - germanic . . qualification on all : it \\'s variable in gothic where it \\'s variable in nt greek : pronoun subjects usually do not invert with the verb , noun subjects usually do . ] a practical point is that , as far as i know , there is an issue about the differentiation of germanic into anything like the modern descendents before the 4 - 5th century . thus , if aux inversion goes back that far , does it matter if it spread from one germanic area to another or if it was part of proto - ( west ? ) germanic ? all innovations must spread before we recognise them as innovations in the language ( or dialect ) . historical linguistics does not study the evolution of the idiolect ( if such a concept as \" evolution of the idiolect \" is even coherent ) . finally , about typological arguments . when morphology-as - fossilized syntax and universal-typology of word order congealed in the early 1970s , some suggested that even before ie was sov it was vso . why ? because subject marking inflection follows the verb : v - s , get it ? inevitably , then , some suggested that celtic maintains the most archaic \" basic \" word order among the ie languages . this is another excess in diachronic application of ( whatever ) the notion of basic word order . the principal objection raised was that it is not obvious ( and even unlikely ) that only basic word orders morphologise . ( in fact , they may be least likely to morphologise . ) considering that s represents an unstressed anaphor in v - s , s might be in a minor word order position . [ and note that if basic word order means when the arguments are nominal , not pronominal , then discourse frequency is not criterial of basic , since at least most subject arguments are pronominal , if not merely inflectional . furthermore , if \" basic \" only counts the relative frequency of subject nominals , it is based on something which is quite rare in discourse : subject nominals ] . in any case , subject inflection following the verb stem is a widespread eurasian areal feature , extending into africa in semitic and various other branches of afro - asiatic . to some this might be taken as a clue to the correctness of nostratic and other super-family notions , to others an indication of an extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless of genetic relationship ( cf . the famous balkan area ) . still others might opt for coincidence . various other languages also have this feature , e . g . , kanuri in west africa and various new world languages . ( welcome to nostratic ? ) questions about the functions of position after the verb in so-called sov languages are raised by v - s inflectional order . the typological implications of this go beyond my current knowledge , although i dimly remember that various eurasian sov languages are different according to whether or what function post-verb - al position has in such languages . this is obvious , for example , in the contrast between eurasian sov languages ( with differences amongst themselves ) and the so-called sovx west african languages , where x is an adpositional phrase ( with complications about the origin of adpositional phrases in such languages which i will refrain from discussing here ) . since so many eurasian sov languages are also v - s inflectional languages , i do not know if there are sov languages which have a \" minor \" postverbal position for an anaphoric subject ( such that it turns up in other positions in certain constructions , so that we can demonstrate that it is not an inflection ) . maybe typology of relevant amerind languages will help solve this problem . but maybe we may also anticipate the reappearance of the party-spoiling question about the representativeness of curent language types to possible ( and former ) language types . no doubt an unwelcome ( and unhelpful ? ) thought to many . in this context it seems worth mentioning that mathematical probability arguments for various word orders , as i have seen them practiced , are not impressive , because of faults in their initial assumptions . for example , as far as i know , they invariably assume the validity of counting number of languages , regardless of the genetic relationship or areal contiguity of the languages counted . this seems unsound to me , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . for example , we find ( i think ) that the eurasian area , consisting of umpteen and umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring the position of the verb as an independent variable ) . then in the new world we find large areas of contiguous s . . . o order , and separate areas of o . . . s order . maybe we should be calculating mathematical probability on the basis of contiguous area rather than number of languages . the surprising result might be that o . . . s is more probable than s . . . o ( where area is an independent variable , not individual language , of course . ) i \\' m not sure what the implications of this might be , but one might be that o . . . s might have once been a more likely ordering strategy than it is now , and that the predominance of s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely the result of areal spread . [ if the spread of s . . . o is old enough , its predominance might even be the result of an absolute increase in the number of \" languages \" in the world all together . however , this is n\\'t really relevant to my criticim of the way probability arguments have been applied to syntactic typology , only to the historical implications of adequate assumptions about language typology . in fact , i \\' ll leave this discussion with the already widely accepted suggestion that strategies for information distribution in the clause , esp . in terms of old / new , are more relevant to typology than such problematic notions for cross-linguistic comparison as subject and object . similarly , for example , i think that in eurasia , agent . . . patient / theme order largely cuts across ergative and accusative languages , even though ergative languages would have patient / theme , or whatever term you want , as subject . to this extent , s . . . o cannot be universal even in eurasia , without confusing \" accusative \" definitions of subject and object , where subject status is consistent with case-marking , and \" ergative \" definitions , where case-marking is more closely tied to transitivity role than to the mushy cross-linguistic concept of subject . ] fn : \" and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . \" bw : i think the thrust of fn \\'s suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( on the basis of older ideas about creoles ? ) . however , questions remain in my mind about conditions under which these things happen . within monolingual areas ( or among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types of ? ) syntactic strategies seem to have the potential to spead quite quickly , perhaps almost as quickly as new words and expressions , while comparable speed is not generally observed for phonological change ( and is probably \" unlikely or impossible \" , as newmeyer puts it , for both internal linguistic and social reasons - - in fact , i think \" unlikely \" is more accurate than \" impossible \" depending on the nature of the particular type of phonological change , and i have an example of possible single-generation phonological change in the current english of the african americans in new york city area , but i do not have sufficient data to make this possibility or its implications worth discussing here - - until i get to the section in labov \\'s new book where he discusses recent innovations in the chicago vowel system i will not be sure if he has other examples ) . however , to the extent that language-contact propels \" cataclysmic \" syntactic change ( in the historical record ) fn \\'s suggestion is not so clear . for example , english in east la ( a mexican american community ) is more immediately strikingingly different from adjacent english dialects on the phonological than on the syntactic level . and that applies to monolingual speakers of east la english as well as spanish - english bilinguals , and to various phonological segments as well as intonational contours ] . in understanding historical syntactic evolution , it is most often difficult to distinguish internal evolution from language contact ( hence the sour regard for substratal theories during the late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration of neogrammarian achievements ) - - and then there is also jakobson \\'s caution that language contact might not permit evoluton that is not internally possible anyway , rather that it can only promote one possible direction of change as opposed to other possible directions which might flourish under other external circumstances . this too i consider problematic as a blanket statement , but a major consideration to keep in mind as a possible constraint on change in most reconstructive expeditions into the unknown past . enough . these are my thoughts about the problems of using the comparative method alone to reconstruct syntax . but nobody would suggest something so foolish as not enlisting all possible tools of reconstruction , including internal and typological in addition to comparative . conversely , it would be equally foolish to shun the comparative method as a reconstructive tool . in any case , the notion of basic word order is not helpful to syntactic reconstruction , if not of doubtful value as an autonomous observation about the synchronic state of any language as well . i mean it \\'s ok to observe that english and french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even more than english - - not least because of the former \\'s preferred question formation strategies ) , but without further discussion that does not mean that their syntaxes are \" basically \" the same , in any insightful or interesting ( to coin an adjective ) sense . i would like readers to react to any of the points i have made above , not least of all the accuracy of the facts i have suggested for various languages , since i am not an expert in the areas of most of the facts i have presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian and new world areal syntactic characteristics . benji\\n',\n",

              " \"subject: comparative syntax\\n \\n while i really like most of what scott delancey had to say about syntactic reconstruction usually being based on clues buried in the morphology ( or morphophonology ) , i do n't think this is always the case . there is a rather famous example involving a rule of ancient greek and one variety of old iranian ( the languages of the gatha 's , i seem to recall ) , whereby a neuter pl . subject triggers sg . agreement on a verb , a pattern which is often reconstructed for the proto-language because , as i understand it , of its apparent oddity . this reconstruction is not logically dependent , i do n't believe , on the identity of the actual morphemes marking gender , number , and person in these languages . i would think that there are many such quirks of syntax which could be the basis of a reconstruction . e . g . , polish and several other indo - european languages show traces of a pattern whereby an np referring to a group composed of males and females is grammatically neuter . i have been playing around with the idea of trying to reconstruct this as an old pattern which would be quite independent of the particular number morphemes involved ( b . t . w . , if anyone knows of any literature on this phenomenon , i would be grateful for any references and will post them in summary form ) . another example ( which is not so interesting , because we happen to know the history ) : russian does various complicated things with the case / number endings of the nouns and adjectives when combined with numerals . thus , in the nominative case , ' these adj n ' and ' two adj n ' show different adj and noun forms in russian , where in the presence of a numeral from 2 to 4 the adj has to be in what looks the gen . pl . form ( unless it is feminine , when either the gen . pl . or the gen . sg . is possible ) and the noun in what looks like the gen . sg . form ( except for one or two nouns which seem to take a special form differing in stress placement from the gen . sg . ) . closely related polish , on the other hand , does nothing special in this case ( though both languages do other weird things with numerals above 4 , which need not concern us ) . i wonder if we would not be able to conclude from such behavior that the ancestor of these languages had a distinct paucal number ( 2 - 4 being paucal ) category , which then merged with the plural in polish , but stayed distinct in russian ( with the further hypothesis that some of the paucal endings must have looked like the genitive sg . ones ) . and an even further hypothesis might be that the paucal was originally dual , since paucal is a very unusual category to have . of course , we know that this is what happened , but i wonder if we could not have reconstructed it even if had not known . so , provided the syntactic patterns are distinctive ( e . g . , weird ) enough , purely syntactic comparative reconstruction should be possible ( and i bet that we could even find some more examples of it in the literature besides the greek - iranian one cited above ) . the problem only seems impossible when we consider patterns which are quite prosaic ( and where the number of possibilities is small ) , like the so-called basic word order that has been talked about so much in this discussion . even there , i think , that if we looked at the detailed facts of word order ( not just ov , vo , and the like ) in a group of languages , we might be able to reconstruct the proto - system of word order with some degree of confidence . and even the basic order might be reconstructable enough if we have enough languages with enough diversity and ( geographical ) dispersion between them . the fact that classical latin was often verb-final , while all the romance languages are verb-middle or verb-initial , does not seem to be a very important counterexample , because ( a ) vernacular latin may well have been much more verb - middle than the literary and it is only the former that is relevant , ( b ) the romance languages do not exhibit very much diversity or dispersion . for ex . , does it not seem clear that we can reconstruct ov for proto - turkic and proto - mongolic ? and vo for proto - polynesian ?\\n\",\n",

              " 'subject: re : 5 . 1414 native speaker intuitions\\n \\n i would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva \\'s questions about control structures like ( 1 ) johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom . ( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the \" unmarked \" case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of \\' ask \\' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation \" going to the bathroom \" . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it \\'s implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of \" role identity \" , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( \" a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german \" ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as \" pragmatic roles \" . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an \" implicit controller \" , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book \" kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive \" published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker \\'s intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany\\n',\n",

as a concrete example , take the fact , recently cited by poser , that all the muskogean evidence in greenberg \\'s book has been found to be tainted by data errors ( geoffrey d . kimball , a critique of muskogean , \" gulf \" , and yukian material in _ language in the americas _ , ijal 58 ( 1992 ) , 447-501 ) . i can imagine how one might want to maintain that even this total collapse of the case on muskogean merely puts us back in a state of being neutral , a priori , on whether muskogean languages are related to other amerindian languages , or to nostratic for that matter . anti - greenberg amerindianists are perfectly prepared to agree that the amerind languages might have descended from a common source now lost . that \\'s neutrality . but suppose we move from that neutrality to the position that we will assume as a default that muskogean is amerind , and so are all the languages of south america , and indeed , that amerind is related to sino - tibetan and both to indo - european and thus nostratic and all of the above to khoisan . . . let us assume for the sake of argument that the world \\'s languages are all genetically related ; but let us take this to be an empirical assumption - - not just a willingness to reject the closet racism that poser says ruhlen once alleged in his critics , or a yearning to find universal brotherhood , but an assumption against which evidence can in principle count . now , what sort of linguistic evidence would count , for greenberg and ruhlen and illich - svitych , as disproving the inclusion of muskogean or any other family in in the conjectural ( though tentatively assumed ) proto - gaeic ? that is , what sort of data pattern or configuration of phonological and grammatical properties could suffice to make the macrocomparativists throw in the towel and go outside to meet the press and concede defeat ? there ought to be some imaginable scenario that would end up with ruhlen telling a group of reporters from the stanford daily and american scientist and other supermarket tabloids , \" well , we thought we could sustain the whole proto - gaeic thing , but that set of paradigms on haida has us beat ; we \\' ve had to concede the haida case ; according to our tests , haida is unrelated to the other human languages . \" ( much scope for new press attention here : \" haida indians are aliens from space , top expert admits . \" ) but what sort of scenario would it have to be , to get the greenberg camp to admit that it was in grave trouble on some relatedness claim ? to be fair , orthodox comparativists might well say that if you put it like this , no answer should be expected . one can argue that a certain methodology applied to a certain set of data yield no evidence for relatedness between burushaski and bushman , but not that it refutes such a relatedness . a positivist view of historical linguistics would see it as maintaining hypotheses about verifiable relatednesses in a very particular form : when i say that german \" pfennig \" comes from an earlier germanic form with initial \" p \" that will be seen in languages like english with no history of a high german sound shift , i am counted as having been supported by the observation that english speakers say \" penny \" ; if the form turned out to be \" twenny \" i would be in trouble ; given german \" pfund \" i am committed to something like \" pund \" in english , and ( given the great english vowel shift ) the discovery of \" pound \" is more good news for me ; and so on . the predictions i am making are about an indefinitely extensible set of pairs ( ger : pfxxx , eng : pxxx ) . now , the falsity of one of these could conceivably taken to refute brittle forms of the hypothesis that english cognates of german pf-words always begin with p - , but it is n\\'t nearly enough to be counterevidence to the whole english / german relatedness claim , of course . that claim would not be given up unless there was a complete collapse of all the evidence : if \" pound \" was established textually to have been a coinage by a novelist who had never heard german , if \" penny \" was shown to be borrowed from italian \" penne \" during a period when pasta had been used for small change , and then all the other sound correspondences started collapsing as well . i \\' m asking this : if the 100 % collapse of greenberg \\'s muskogean evidence , as alleged by kimball , does not count as a complete collapse of the case that muskogean is included in amerind ( hence , a fortiori , of the case that it is in proto - gaeic ) , then i think i need some help in understanding what could be evidence against that inclusion . there had better be something . + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + | g e o f f r e y k . p u l l u m * pullum @ cats . ucsc . edu | | stevenson college , university of california , santa cruz , california 95064 | | ( 408 ) 459-4705 * messages ( 408 ) 459-2555 / 2905 * fax ( 408 ) 459-3334 | + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: comparative method\\n \\n in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and \" a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world \" , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this \" because the cut-off point is so shallow \" , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet \\'s position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that \\'s how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: typology of historical change\\n \\n typology of historical change this note tries to make explicit what i take for granted , and have discussed with others on occasion , but which perhaps needs a more explicit statement . one of the most fruitful avenues of research in distant language comparison , i believe , is the growth of the field i call typology of historical change . under this rubric i include for example the work of johanna nichols ( whether or not i agree with any data , findings or particulars of method , is not relevant to my point ; i still think it helps our thinking along ) . i also include , and this is a challenge i want to issue , the * * * mode of discourse * * * in which mr . vovin asked recently for help in finding typological parallels to a hypothesis he was interested in that a phrase meaning \" water falls \" could fossilize ( ? ) into a basic word for \" rain \" . in response to his query , he got back some positive answers , examples which people claimed fit this description . as a method of reasoning , this is what we need more of . that is , more accumulations of attested examples of particular changes , to educate our intuitions of what we naively think are \" possible \" semantic shifts by ever more experience with what actual semantic shifts are known or suspected . it will help us to improve our methods of guestimating possible language relationships , because it will at least say that a given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , so it is not straining to compare lexical items whose meanings differ in such and such a way . whereas by contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is not firmly attested . so such an unattested semantic shift should probably not be used in those distant language comparisons which are themselves the most difficult to do , because over large time spans the number of context-sensitive conditioning environments is as great as the number of lexical items available to compare , and thus there are few or no * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . in other words , as we move towards deeper comparisons , we must more and more rely on ways of measuring \" distance \" of semantic shift and \" distance \" of phonological change , rather than measuring repeating sound correspondences and semantic identities . we do not yet have our tools for doing this very well sharpened , but we can proceed gradually to sharpen them . a study of the known attested cases is the best start . in other words , if someone really wants to see how our methods fare with gradually more distant language comparisons , and to see how some new methods may fare , they should tabulate , for all known language relationships , ( a ) the proportion of sound-correspondence repetition in the comparable vocabulary ( and what \" comparable \" means is itself a variable , not exclusively defined by ( b ) and ( c ) ) ( b ) the \" semantic distance \" along attested paths of semantic change of lexical items being compared . where multiple such shifts have been attested , the estimated \" distance \" counts as closer , smaller . where few such shifts have been attested , the estimated \" distance \" counts as greater . we of course do not have enough such information in database form to use at present , but whatever we do have can be used provisionally , as explained in ( d ) ( c ) the \" phonetic distance \" along attested paths of phonetic change of lexical items being compared . there is relatively more of this knowledge available than for phonological change . ( d ) exploring how the three measures above vary as we go to greater time depths . that is , using first the more assured cases , then the less assured ones , how does a weighted average of \" closeness \" of compared lexical items vary as we go to increasing time depths ? how does the proportion of regular and often recurring sound correspondences to unique or rarely recurring sound correspondences vary as we go to increasing time depths ? it is the development of the tools in ( b , c ) which will most advance our abilities to compare at greater time depths , improve our methods . i will be very grateful to anyone who points me to studies which approximate to parts of the program outlined just above . \" the comparative method \" currently does not have the benefit of fully developed tools of this kind . to that degree , the current comparative methods can be considered less rigorous than they ought to be , and for that reason not as powerful at distant language comparisons as they will sometime come to be . a future comparative method can use these tools more and more precisely . the real challenge today to existing comparativists is to avoid artificially fossilizing the term \" the comparative method \" , to avoid treating its methods as fixed and not subject to improvement and supplementing with newer and more powerful methods , as are the methods in any other science . it would be healthy if the word \" the \" were dropped from the term and it were made a mass or plural term \" comparative methods \" . that implies no lessening of rigor . indeed , as i have been at pains to point out above , i firmly believe some of the limitations of the present state of comparative methods result from a * * * lack of rigor * * * in the area of the typology of possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed by bill croft in the topic of syntactic reconstruction and typology is certainly relevant to the concerns raised here . i think we are seeing the beginnings of a new paradigm in the focus on paths of change in language , and comparative-historical linguists will be left behind if they do not add these techniques to their box of tools ( while keeping all the good techniques they already have ) . lloyd anderson\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: sum : vowel length in orthographies\\n \\n a few weeks ago i posted a query about the orthographic marking of vowel length , with special reference to korean . i received many very interesting replies , both on korean and on the general question , which i will summarise below - the whole topic raises some issues that people might like to comment further on . first though - thanks to everyone who took the trouble to send me information . it was my first linglist query and i \\' m delighted with the way it works ! it would have taken me ages to assemble all these examples from library research . at first i was surprised to get a lot of replies suggesting as examples of languages that dont mark vowel length , english , german and so on . then i realised i should have been clearer in my original request . a . fox put the problem well with his question : \\' your query about writing and vowel length is slightly odd , since it implies that in most languages with contrastive vowel-length the writing system represents it . but this depends on what you mean by \\' representing \\' vowel-length ; in the sense of having an explicit and consistent marker of length , such as a double letter , a diacritic or other length mark , this is not very common , at least in languages with which i am familiar . but length can be implicitly marked in a variety of ways , and therefore discoverable from the spelling for anyone ( such as the literate native speaker ) who knows the system . \\' i \\'d intended to include all of these things as ways of \\' representing \\' vowel length ; definitely not only cases where vowel length is represented as a feature in its own right by a macron , double symbol etc . so what i wanted was examples of languages with an extensive system of minimal pairs differentiated wholly or mainly by vowel length which have identical orthographic representations of the members of the pairs . this is the situation in korean , for quite a largish set of words of both one and two syllables . it \\'s definitely not the situation in english , german , canadian french , danish etc . i dont think its the situation in latin either , though i might be wrong , and would be glad of correction . here and in quite a few of the other languages that were suggested to me , vowel length is predictable from some other aspect of the word ( including its lexical identity ) so you dont actually get many or any minimal pairs differentiated only by length . right ? the same would appear to be the case for hausa ; and possibly for the other estonian vowel length contrast ? my estonian is a bit rusty , but would i be right in guessing that the full three way contrast is fairly limited ? however , several of the pacific languages that were mentioned to me do seem to fit the bill : tokelauan , samoan , maori , fijian and the ponapeic languages are all candidates for having what i would call a genuine length contrast ( although it seems that in maori at any rate the system of contrasts is quite limited ) , which is at least sometimes not shown in the orthography . so , it seems , does the australian language bardi , and its orthography doesnt show it . . the thing i found very interesting was the number of people who sent anecdotal evidence about how native speakers of these languages feel about marking vowel length . their writing systems are all of course relatively recent introductions based on the roman alphabet , and there are plenty of ways they could show vowel length . but they dont always use this potential it seems . apparently the speakers of ponapeic languages use length marking inconsistently , so do fijian speakers , maori speakers find it \\' unnatural \\' and dont like using it , tokelauan teachers have decided not to teach it , and in samoa use of a length marker is banned ! there seems to be something worth exploring here . the obvious hypothesis is that though the words are differentiated phonetically by length , this is not the distinction that is most salient to the native speakers . the next obvious hypothesis is that it is some kind of lexical distinction , similar to that of english \\' good \\' vs \\' food \\' , \\' boot \\' vs \\'s oot \\' , \\' look \\' vs \\' loop \\' etc that is perfectly simple for native speakers and horrible for learners . ( which could also explain why gaelic has taken the opposite trend and started marking vowel length where it never used to , since it is used so much nowadays by less than fully native speakers . . . ) . thoughts on these hypotheses would be gratefully received . but back to korean . . . this still seems like a very unusual situation to me . it seems likely and indeed it was suggested by some of the korean respondents that the original hangul did have a length marker , but i have found no evidence for this in my research on hangul . ( that \\'s why i posted the orginal query , and i ve just had another look at ledyard \\'s thesis on the topic . ) maybe i just need to do more careful research : pointers on this also gratefully received . a couple of points of clarification : the distinction between the monosyllabic vowel length \\' minimal pairs \\' does seem to be dying out ( though it is the fact that it previously existed but was not marked in the writing system at that time that i find odd ; could it be that the lack of orthographic representation contributes to its demise ? ? ) . but there is a clear distinction in the sound of the two syllable pairs . to my ears these distinction seems to be much more one of pitch accent than of length . and : when i said that native speakers dont easily identify vowel length , i didnt mean that they say \\' my language doesnt have a vowel length distinction \\' - which would indeed be a statement to be cautious of ! i meant they dont know which word is supposed to have the long vowel and which the short . this is consistent with information sent by native speakers that it is something taught in schools as a prescriptive rule well for anyone who has read this far , let me reward you by sharing with you this response from fran karttunen ( i hope she doesnt mind ) . i dont know exactly how to interpret it with respect to my questions above , but i \\' m sure there \\'s something in it for all of us ! \\' both the maya and the nahua ( speakers of unrelated mesoamerican languages ) had achieved a partially-syllabic approach to writing before the arrival of europeans in the first quarter of the 16th century . from what we can tell of their writing , both made some use of rhebus principles in which a drawing of thing , the name of which was similar rather than identical , was used to suggest the intended word / syllable . for instance , a drawing of a a bare bottom ( tzin-tli \" buttocks \" ) was used for the honorific suffix - tzin . likewise a drawing of a banner , pan-tli was used for locative - pan . these two examples are suffixes , but there are similar cases for initial syllables of nahuatl noun stems , for instance . vowel length , at least for nahuatl , is not taken into account in these cases . the honorific suffix today has the reflex of a long vowel in most modern dialects of nahuatl , making it homophonous with the stem of \" buttocks \" , but attestation from the sixteenth century consistently show them to contrast in vowel length ( short for the honorific , long for \" buttocks \" ) . same for \" banner \" ( long vowel ) versus the locative ( short ) . \\' thanks again to all respondents , who are listed below as acknowledgment .

              " 'subject: comparative method\\n \\n these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser \\'s message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally \\'s general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer \\'s statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer \\'s ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer \\'s second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the \" true \" or \" real \" work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter \\'s recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer \\'s point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : \" since it is clear that everybody \\'s first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . \" ( please note the words \" first approximation \" in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : \" on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . \" ( please note the words \" the only way \" and \" establish \" . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter \\'s criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) \" systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies \" may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the \" real work \" and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving \" nothing at all \" regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is \" real work \" . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally \" the real work \" . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser \\'s message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser \\'s mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser \\'s paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser \\'s message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg \\'s errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg \\'s method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg \\'s methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are \" obviously \" cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article \" common pathways of illumination \" by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) \" chance lookalikes \" certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of \" chance lookalikes \" to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of \" substrate \" and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg \\'s errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg \\'s original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether \" limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . \" please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser \\'s assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser \\'s supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg \\'s hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser \\'s conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as \" the \" ( read \" the only \" ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg \\'s data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the \" holy \" and the \" unclean \" , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser \\'s discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be \" necessary to exclude chance \" . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of \" the comparative method \" which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso \\'s contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled \" typology of historical change \" . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard \\'s nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson\\n',\n",

far / text-so - far \" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in \" official \" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : -

              " 'subject: rate of loss for \" basic \" vocabulary\\n \\n some months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n\\'t have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt \\'s data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt \\'s or guy \\'s assumption that the \" prolem \" lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: re : 5 . 1462 comparative method\\n \\n a couple of remarks on recent exchange on comparative method : 1 ) as far as importance of morphology is concerned i believe that alexis is right ( sorry , karl ! ) . it is important , but i think that it would be impossible to insist that only morphological prallels like latin est , sunt and german ist , sind cited by karl teeter can prove relationship . old church slavic has the parallel forms iest # and so ~ t # , perfectly agreeing with karl teeter \\'s latin and german . however , in modern russian the present of copula dissapeared ( we can still recognize forms like iest \\' and sut \\' , but they sound bitterly archaic ) : on student ( he [ is ] student ) , oni studenty ( they [ are ] stu - dents ) . let us imagine the situation when the only surviving slavic language is russian and we just do not have old church slavonic materials . does the lack of the paradigm make russian less \" indoeuropean \" than latin or german , or does it make impossible the proof of its ie nature ? i think that the answer is in the negative . second , alexis is certainly right when he says that a refusal to admit lexical evidence will make impossible to prove that mandarin is related to cantonese or that vietnamese is related to khasi . even worse , we won\\'t be able to state that beijing mandarin is related to xi \\' an mandarin , or that hanoi vietnamese is related to saigon vietnamese , as nothing resembling est , sunt / ist , sind can be found in these closely related dialects . moreover , we would have to dismantle the families of north and north east asia as well , since their agglutinative morphology also does not exhibit anything of the kind ie does . therefore , continuing this claim logically to its end , we will have to state that there are around 50 unrelated languages in japan alone , because we have no possibility to prove the genetic relationship of various japanese dialects and subdialects , since they do not have a grammar like ie . there are cases when proof of genetic relationship is based mostly on grammar , but there are cases when it rests solely on lexical items , as well as there are lucky cases like ie when one can demonstrate the relatedness on the basis of both grammar and lexicon . absolutization of any of this cases may lead us to dismissal of pretty well established language families . the cases like \" proto _ english - french \" can actually be easily controlled by using basic voca - bulary in lexical comparisons : no matter how many romance words were borrowed b yenglish , its basic vocabulary is still germanic , which can be easily demon - strated , contrary to those who try to label the very idea of basic vocabulary as \" semantic primitive \" . 2 ) geoffrey pullum writes : ) i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , prefererably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? the same things as in case of lower-level comparisons : either lack of regular phonetic correspondences , or lack of enough number of cognates , representing basic vocabulary items and / or basic morphological markers , established on the basis of these regular correspondences . this is why i , not being amerindianist myself , cannot believe in amerind : greenberg did not present any correspondences at all , and his whole method of \" mass comparisons \" is in direct violation of traditional and conservative comparative methodology . therefore , i would side with greenberg opponents on this matter . but i believe that it is absolutely unfair to put illich - svitych in one company with greenberg and ruhlen , as geoffrey pullum does in his posting . illich - svitych work starts with charts of phonetic correspondences , which do work regularly throughout his 3 - volume work , and is , therefore , in sharp contrast with greenberg \\'s \" mass comparisons \" . the whole work , at least in the areas i can judge of ( altaic and uralic ) is done with painstaiking care and accuracy , reflecting the state of the art , contemporary to the time when his work was done ( sixties ) . may be the opponents of long-range compa - rison should at last familiarize themselves with works of illich - svitych , dolgopol \\'s kii and others , which as i believe represent a successful long-range comparative work ( though it does not necessarily mean that i agree with all illich - svitych \\'s proposals : many things remain to be done ) , rather then to repeat the groundless allegations in illich - svitych address , and come forward with some concrete arguments against his work , rather than general statements that illich - svitych \\'s work is like greenberg \\'s or that there is a ceiling to the comparative method . sincerely , sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: comparative method and geoff pullum\\n \\n i have a problem : geoff \\'s posting sounds like it assumes ( a ) that there are only two sides to the issues under discussion and ( b ) that one of them is \" orthodox \" and the other one ( the i am on , apparently ) little short of crazy , the suggestion being that those who defend the idea that there are linguistic relationships to be discovered beyond the ones which were known in 1840 or some such cut-off date ( the so-called \" remote \" or \" distant \" connections ) might go so far as to accept that all of greenberg \\'s muskogean data are wrong and yet to maintain that muskogean is amerind ( without citing any new data ! ) . i think the reality is quite different . for example , victor golla , karl teeter , and i ( although we have been debating some methodological issues relevant to nostratic ) are actually very close on most issues ( except the ones under discussion , apparently ) and in particular on most issues concerning the proposed amerind grouping . there are lots of historical linguists with different ( and crossclassifying ! ! ) views on these matters ( for example , eric hamp has been widely quoted on his views against nostratic , yet he has been a staunch defender of altaic and of a connection between luoravetlan and eskimo - aleutian ; many of those who like nostratic do not like amerind ; and so on . i think each case deserves to be examined on its merits , the whole idea of contrasting \" orthodox \" ( or \" mainstream \" ) with \" remote \" or \" distant \" comparisons is without foundation and can lead to further needless polarization , and finally i feel that methodological issues and substantive ones should be discussed separately ( and that the latter are the more important , even if the former are often the more seductive ) . and to close on a positive note ( consonant with the spirit of the season ) , if karl teeter and i can reach the point where our major remaining disagreements are ( a ) whether in principle one could or could not write a comparative grammar of anglo - french , and ( b ) whether in fact the work done to date on nostratic is sufficient to taking it as a working hypothesis that at least indo - european , uralic , altaic , kartvelian , and afro - asiatic are related and going further , then i think we have achieved considerable progress ( and i am not even sure we even disagree about these points any more , for as the discussion goes on , more and more mutual misunderstandings seem to disappear ) . there will , of course , remain a lot of hard work to be done , on these and even more on other language families , but i do not see why the inevitable disagreements should be considered any more of a problem than the disagreements within the indo - europeanist community about the different versions of the laryngeal theory or about the glottalic theory , etc .\\n',\n",
              " \"subject: re : 5 . 1462 comparative method\\n \\n geoff pullum has raised the question of the null hypothesis with respect to proto - world and long-distance relatedness . i would suggest that the lack of progress in the dispute may be due in part to the conflict between two ways of setting the null hypothesis . a priori , in terms of evoutionary considerations , long range relationships going back to a single ancestor are to be expected : this point has been made by numerous linguists in discussion , if not so often in print . however , methodological considerations force us to set the null hypothesis the other way , since we clearly cannot disprove long-distance relatedness . the problem is analogous to medical disputes : there are plenty of researchers who would like to show once and for all that homeopathy , acupuncture etc . are of no benefit in the treatment of the illnesses for which such effects are claimed . but all that can be said is that we have no scientifically respectable evidence that homeopathy works ( please note that this is a purely methodological point - i do n't want to see linguist cluttered with replies disputing the homeopathic facts ! ) the greenbergian dispute is even less likely to be resolved by disproving long-distance relatedness hypotheses than the homeopathic one , since in the latter case one can at least do controlled trials : while there have been proposals on controlling for chance similarities , there will always be too many variables involved for the greenbergian null hypothesis to be refuted . steve matthews\\n\",\n",

              " 'subject: comparative method\\n \\n just as morris halle once pointed out that any phonological system could be analyzed as having two phonemes , so too it seems clear that any two languages , related or not , could have a reconstruction done for them , involving both a set of correspondences among the words or morphemes and a comparative grammar . and just as in fact a phonology with only two phonemes would be just a formal excersise and not a real phonology , so too the \" reconstruction \" i am referring to would have no validity unless the languages really are related ( or in the case of mixed languages , unless the relevant parts were related ) . but the formal possibility is important to the following extent : it shows that we cannot assume that the ability to write a comparative grammar is either necessary or sufficient for showing that the languages in question are related . it is the ability to write a convincing comparative gramm ` r that is significant here , but by the same token language relatedness can be sjown by establishing a convincing set of correspodences between suitable sets of words or morphemes of the languages being compared . i will even conceded that it is harder , in general , to be convincing in the case of a comparative grammar than it is in the case of a set of correspondences ( since the former would seem to include the latter plus a lot more ) . but what no one has yet shown here or anywhere else is that the only way to establish language relatedness is by writing a complete comparative grammar , and even meillet conceded by 1925 that you cannot even demand a fragment of a grammar because there are perfectly well-established families where this either has not been or indeed cannot be done . it is another matter 9and ultimately a more interesting one ) that significant amount of grammatical comparison ( though not a whole grammar ) has been offered for nostratic ( a theory i find likely though perhaps not yet established ) as well as for amerind ( a theory which i find basically as unsupported as do karl and victor , for example ) . and it is perhaps not uninteresting that illich - svitych proposed to write a nostratic comparative grammar but never did , much as sapirpromised to write one for uto - aztecan but failed to ( though we should in all fairness note that sapir lived for another two decades , whereas illich - svitych died without even finishing the lexical and morphemic comparisons which are the bulk of the evidence that we have in the public domain for nostratic ) . this is no criticism of sapir , of course , if we agree that there was no need to write a comparatve grammar of uto - aztecan in order for everybody to be able to see that the uto - aztecan languages are related . just as there is no need for this in the case of nostratic 9and indeed given the age of proto - nostratic , if there was such a language , it seems unlkikely that we will ever have more than a very partial grammar\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: \" syntax and the comparative method\\n \\n concerning syntax and the comparative method : if i understand it correctly , amr @ ares . cs . wayne . edu ( no name ) apparently believes that under certain circumstances one can indeed use syntax as part of the comparative method and cites among other things , the case of a neuter plural in classical greek and old iranian used with a verb in the singular and its possible implications for a similar structure in the proto - language . while i do in theory believe that a particular construction can indeed survive the ravages of time and give us clues to the syntax of earlier levels , this must always be the last criterium we apply and can almost never be used as a sort of proof - unless of course , ( i believe scott de lancey mentioned it , but i \\' m not sure ) we can show that , for example , all ergative case endings ( i believe the example was tibeto - burman ) can be traced back to a common form and the morphology , when reconstructed from the \\'d aughter \\' languages , conclusively points , in this case , to an ergative \\' mother \\' language . otherwise , john cowan seems to have summed it up best , citing robbin burling \\'s book : man \\'s many voices . . . just as every language at one point or another borrows lexemes from another langauge , there are literally thousands of examples of langauges borrowing syntactic constructions from other languages , whether substrats or not - even english has a good share of these borrowings . we cannot forget that an extremely large portion of the world \\'s population is by necessity bi - or tri-lingual , many of whom cannot even read their own native language , not to mention the other ( s ) or have any kind of linguistic training or sensiti - vity and would therefore pay much attention as to what language a particular construction comes from . there are also the famous \\' sprachbunds \\' , such as the balkan area and to a certain extent south asia , where through everyday necessity , a large part of the population speaks at least two langauges , as was shown in the case of the village along the maharastra - mysore boundary , ( mentioned by john cowan above ) where one can translate word-for - word from one language into another , although the languages are not - strictly speaking - related . in this case , though , it does n\\'t even seem to make sense to speak of language families . in my opinion , the only possible connection is that of language contact or sprachbund . maybe that is part of the problem - what are \\' related \\' languages , anyway ? we must also remember that this process has undoubtedly been going on ever since people could speak . it would n\\'t be difficult to propose , going back to our starting point , a theoretical language contact area for greek and iranian . for example , georgian , at least the modern language , only uses the plural verb for humans . although objects can appear in the plural , the verb appears in the singular . as there have always been greek \\' colonies \\' throughout the region , one could just as well assume a kind of sprachbund for the whole region at that time , which would be even easier as we know so little about the pre-historic era in that region , making it difficult to disprove . even today , there are certain \\' areal \\' characteristics such as evidential perfects , and many languages are , or have been at one point , split ergative in the region stretching from nepal to the caucusus , etc . seen in this light , then , we can\\'t really speak of the \\' oddity \\' of the construction with a neutral plural taking a verb in the singular , which , by the way , in my opinion at least , does have a certain semantic justification and is by no means \\' odd \\' . concerning indo - aryan , the comparative method applied to syntax would certainly give us the ( wrong ) conclusion that vedic sanskrit was a split-ergative language , as all modern indo - aryan languages except standard oriya and begali ( and assamese ? ) are either ergative or split - ergative languages , and many dialects of these three langauges are also split-ergative languages . as there are several hundred ia \\' langauges \\' , would n\\'t we be forced to assume that this goes back to the parent language ? but there is also a problem here with the traditional method . we have ( to a large extent ) cognate endings for the ergative case . so why is n\\'t vedic a split-ergative language ? because we have gone back too far . split ergativity is part of the \\' parent \\' language , but this is presumably to be found in middle indic . for a language family about which we know next to nothing , then , this would certainly lead to tremendous errors . so , it seems to me that , although there are indeed useful insights to be gained by looking at the syntax , it should , as i stated earlier , always be the last criterium , if used at all , in arguing for a kind of genetic relationship . when we have no written history of the peoples of the area , very little in the way of documented sound changes , etc . , we simply cannot say anything yet about the syntactic structure of the proto-language . that will undoubtedly come about in the course of time , but it is just one of many features , none of which alone can \\' prove \\' anything , except perhaps contact . if there are enough of the \\' unlikely \\' correspondences ( i . e . \\' ist / sind \\' and \\' est / sunt \\' ) , then one can speak with relative security of a genetic relationship , whatever that exactly means . john peterson , kiel , germany\\n',\n",

              " 'subject: re : 5 . 1484 comparative syntax\\n \\n since chet creider \\'s posting of 8 dec rightly corrected some misinformation i gave in my off-the - top-of - the-head posting about karamojong , i decided to make amends by doing a little research ( very little ) to check the rest of what i said . consider it a xmas gift . below is the relevant section of recent nilo - saharan classification ( sudanic : nilotic ) . it \\'s basically the same as greenberg ( 1963 ) with some refinements in further branching but no rearrangement of limbs . east sudanic has four branches , including eastern and western , then nilotic with three branches , including west , east and south . karamojong belongs to the east branch of the nilotic branch of east sudanic . it is therefore classified as closer to maasai ( maa - lotuko branch ) and bari ( bari branch ) than to the lwo branch of the west branch of nilotic , but no closer to kalenjin , a group in the south branch ( e . g . , nandi ) than to the west branch . the following is a relatively recent classification , such as found in schadeberg \\'s ( 1981 ) article on nilo - saharanisch . central sudanic : moru - madi - lugbara etc east sudanic : eastern : nubian western : tama , daju kuliak : ik , so nilotic : west : ( some call it north nilotic ) burun : idem nuer - dinka : idem lwoo : north : shilluk , anwak south : achooli , luo east : ( some call it central nilotic ) bari : bari , kakwa etc maa - lotuko : maasai etc teso - turkana : karamojong , jie etc south : kalenjin : nandi - markweta : nandi , tuken elgon : sapiny , pok okiek / dorobo : sogoo etc datoga : etc beside the bewildering array of east and west branches of branches down the sudanic line i can trace my inaccuracy to conolly \\'s mention of jie . as a language , jie , along with karamojong and various other languages such as teso , are part of the teso - turkana branch of east nilotic . however , in an earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is the name used for west nilotic ( or at least the current lwo and nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means \" people \" ( or \" ordinary people \" ) in most of the west nilotic languages , hence the classificational name . the dinka call themselves \" jieng \\' \" . i suspect that the east nilotic jie ( also spelled \" jiye \" ) is the same word , but i have n\\'t checked if the jie actually call themselves that . african language nomenclature is full of terms not used by the speakers themselves ( but often by sarcastic neighbors , so that , for example , while the dinka evidently see no stigma in their autonym , the achooli use the term somewhat like english uses the term \" the masses \" , cf . hoi polloi ) . just for fun let \\'s see how accurate what i said was about the numbers from one to ten are . we do n\\'t need six through nine , because they are compounds of five plus numbers under five . the data for most languages are restricted to what i happened to have within reach without doing library research . however , the data for bari and teso ( ateso , in my experience ) are from transcriptions of recordings i made a long time ago in east africa before i even knew how these languages were classified . i do n\\'t have published linguistic data on hand for them . in all cases i have simplified orthography for typographical ease ( losing information ) . for example , the \" h \" following a vowel refers to the retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position of that vowel . the nilotic languages have complex vowel systems with \" tense \" and \" lax \" subsystems . of course , lexical numbers by themselves do not prove anything about genetic af finities . nevertheless , some interesting patterns emerge to compare with the currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang \\' we : hn ang \\' wehnoh ang \\' wen ng \\' wan ng \\' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl the first consonant in \\' 5 \\' seems to be diagnostic of the distinctness of nuer - dinka from the lwoo group . otherwise , dinka \\' 1 \\' is wierd , and so is the first consonant of dinka \\' 10 \\' ( cf . dinka - nuer \\' 5 \\' ) , but not much wierder than a comparison of indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic \\' 4 - 5 \\' or slavic \\' 9-10 \\' ) . reconstruction is not difficult , although you do n\\'t have an accurate transcription of the vowel distinctions ( or tone ) . east and south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling \\' diopeti - bo akenge kow ( southern also \\' hal \\' ) 2 morehk iyere - re aeng lamma 3 msala : iu ~ li - uni somok siddah 4 ingwan iwong \\' wahn - ong \\' uan angwan afar 5 mukanad ikany imiet mut shan 10 pwahk itomony tomon taman tommon the numbers \\' 2 \\' and \\' 4 \\' are consistent with west nilotic . otherwise , lexicon appears to be areally defined . first maasai and nandi seem to have a cognate for west nilotic \\' 5 \\' . however , maasai is classified with bari and teso as east nilotic . thus , bari and teso seem to share an innovation for \\' 5 \\' which does not extend to maasai or south nilotic . meanwhile the cognacy of bari \\' 3 \\' with teso and maasai is questionable , and nandi \\' 3 \\' is beyond the pale . interestingly , my data for bari has \\' 10 \\' as given , while greenberg gives bari \\' 10 \\' as \" mere \" in one of his mass cognate sets ( p . 106 ) . \" pwahk \" fits in with the west nilotic set , but presumably g \\'s data comes from a published source . ( i have n\\'t loo ked at my data since i transcribed it - - several decades , but i relistened to my bari tape to make sure i had n\\'t transposed the word for \\' 10 \\' with some other word like \\' toothbrush \\' . ) by the way , teso is closely related to karamojong so i would expect the numbers to be similar , including the cushitic loan for \\' 10 \\' , but with doubts about whether karamojong \\' 5 \\' would follow the maasai or bari - teso pattern . ( gotta go to the library for this one . any volunteers ? ) the word for \\' 10 \\' in the other east and south nilotic languages was recognised by g as a loan from somali or one of the mutually intelligible galla languages of cushitic . that \\'s why i gave the somali numbers above . easy to see it would be a lot more difficult to argue for somali as nilotic than for the other languages [ uhm , if their other lexical correspondences behave like their numbers - - which they do . . . g actually uses the example of cushitic multiple of ten in maasai in his arguments against meinhof \\'s nilo - hamitic hypothesis . cushitic was part of \" hamitic \" in the older terminology ( \" afro - asiatic \" is g \\'s coinage for older \" semito - hamitic \" ) . . note nubian \\' 10 \\' below . . thus , g has been as sharp to use arguments about borrowing against his opponents as have his opponents against him . what to do ? east sudanic central sudanic nubian lugbara 1 we : rum aluh 2 awum iri 3 toskum na 4 kemsum su 5 dijum towi 10 dimnum muhdri wow ! numbers do n\\'t help unite nubian as a branch of east sudanic with nilotic . obviously other criteria were used . for superifical impression nubian \\' 10 \\' looks promising as cognate with south and most of east nilotic , and maybe it is , but that card has already been played non-genetically above - - and with good reason . . g , p106 again , compares bari \\' 10 \\' \" mere \" with khordofan nubian \" bure \" for the same ) . as central sudanic , lugbara might be expected by the naive to be even more different from nilotic than nubian , but the numbers do n\\'t show that . g uses lugbara \\' 2 \\' in his mass cognate sets for the unity of central and east sudanic . interestingly , he also uses dinka \\' 1 \\' , the wierd one for west nilotic , in the same mass cognate sets - - for comparison with \\' 10 \\' in some central sudanic groups . lots of interesting claims there , e . g . , the most common west nilotic word for \" one \" is not proto - west nilotic , let alone proto - nilotic ( despite the suggestiveness of bari and nandi \\' 1 \\' above ) . g could be right , for all i know . anyway , i \\' m just as interested in the areal cross-currents as in the hypotheses about genetic relationships . thus , other implications emerge from g \\'s mass comparison s , e . g . , the pan -

( i do n\\'t know if such a thing is even possible ; there may be too much disagreement on what a font for language _ _ _ _ _ should look like . we seem to disagree on just about every other topic , but that \\'s healthy , i think . ) if i could develop a repository for fonts , then , for example , i could write a paper about the cahuilla language and e-mail the paper anywhere in the world along with the font ( s ) necessary to read / print the paper . ( copyrighted fonts would have to be purchased from the source . ) others could do the same with \" their \" languages . often , when writing papers , and quoting the works of others , i need to write using a non-standard font , so i need to make it myself , then go back to my writing . i have n\\'t counted them , but i have a bunch of partial fonts for many languages , both orthography and ipa . however , these partially completed fonts are based on books written as far back as the 1800s . i seriously doubt that they represent current writing systems . i do n\\'t want to step on anybody \\'s toes , but i can develop a font for any language out there . i can do both truetype and postscript fonts for both the pc and macs . however , if somebody else has already done the work , it makes sense to use their fonts . why re-invent the wheel ? as far as naming the fonts i \\' ve created , i \\' ve been using the three-letter language codes from _ ethnologue : languages of the world _ , ed . barbara f . grimes , 12th ed . , 1992 . for example , my cahuilla orthography is c-chl . ttf ( truetype for pc ) , and my cahuilla ipa is c-chl - p . ttf . i recently responded to jan tent \\'s posting about yesterday , today , and tomorrow words . i sent her words in north american indian languages . she wrote back asking about some of the symbols i had used . if a common font set was available , i could have e-mailed her a font for her computer , and she could have read my reply with the native orthography and ipa pronunciations in the document i sent . to me , it seems that this would be useful to people . i \\'d like to hear others \\' opinions about such a project ( in addition to where to ftp or buy fonts ) . i would especially like to hear from the indigenous language speakers on this list , in addition to the linguists . so send me your information and opinions , even if the opinion is , \" chuck , you \\' re an idiot . scrap the whole idea . \" i \\' ll post a summary to the list if there \\'s enough interest , otherwise i \\' ll respond personally . if you need a font for a language you \\' re working on , let me know that , too . happy holidays , chuck coker work : ( 909 ) 882-2099 ( united states ) home : ( 909 ) 886-5035 ( united states ) e-mail : cjcoker @ csupomona . edu = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there have been no dragons in my life , only small spiders and stepping in gum . i could have coped with the dragons . - - anonymous ( but wise )\\n',\n",

( i might also pronounce it as / esri lanka / ; but this is due to the fact that we do n\\'t like sequences / sc / as onsets of words . you may have already realized that if you have listened to spanish people speaking english . many of the them would say / espein / instead of / spein / ) . in argentina sri lanka is pronounced : [ siri lanka ] . the [ r ] sound is according to ipa : is a post-dental percusive sound . the [ n ] is velar . i just called my daughter who is a writer at la jornada , a local newspaper . she works in the economics section . she said that their spelling is just like english , although she supposes that some \" purist \" publications probably change the k for a c . she wrote sri lanka on a piece of paper and asked the 5 people who were in the office to pronounce it . she confirmed my own suspicion that people pronounce it as if it were in spanish - - two of them with a rather marked e at the beginning , which is what spanish phonology would require with st - , for instance . the rest of us tend to sonorize the s - , but that would be expected in mexican spanish anyway . so , her conclusion ( and mine - - we \\' re both speakers of spanish as a 1st lang ) is that it \\'s pronounced \" normally . \" she has worked with a number of argentine journalists and never noticed that they did anything worth noting , which means that they probably pronounce it just about the same . from : in % \" penaja @ wkuvx1 . wku . edu \" juan antonio pena as far as spelling , sri lanka is the spanish orthography for this asian country . as far as phonetics , the only thing worth noting is that we insert an \\' e \\' [ e ] sound at the beginning of the word sri . spanish does this with all words beginning s + any stop consonant . in spain , the name of the state is written as in english : sri lanka ( the geographical name of the island is ceilan - - with an accent on the \\' a \\' ) . the pronunciation ( in tv and broadcasting ) varies : some people says [ sri \\' lanka ] , some others [ esri \\' lanka ] ( r stands for the multiple trill of - rr - in spanish , the same sound as in perro ) . hear in spain we use to pronounce the name of the old island of ceilan in two different ways . the most common pronunciation is [ esrri lan , ka ] ( i use double r for the spanish hard r and [ n , ] for the velarized nasal sound ) . there is another pronunciation , not so common as the former : [ siri lan , ka ] . i do not know the origin of this one . so there you have it . my impression is that / esrilanka / is more common in spain , and / sirilanka / more prevalent in south america , but this is obviously not absolute . many thanks to all those who responded . marc picard\\n',\n",

( it is obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac \\'s , but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even . i \\' m not ready to change though . i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n\\'t say whether you \\' re a mac or pc person , but the reviews of word 6 for mac were uniformly enormously negative : they actually ported woindows onto the mac ! since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully , we can\\'t imaging why they did that ! the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you are evern going to use alien scripts , there \\'s no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lots of platforms , ioncluding windows ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapters that are separate files , etc . it only is n\\'t woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 was sort of , but was buggy , and in the just-released version 5 , they abancdoned it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports , though the special fonts that come with wp ( which are true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends . ] i am in a similar situation : my new office computer came with microsoft office , which includes word . i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word , i have about abandoned the idea . the main reason , for me , is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabets , most of the ipa alphabet , characters for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , comes with hardly any of these . so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number examples or anything at all . the terminology is a bit different though , which is why i was confused . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people told me that they had gotten this to work , though they did n\\'t all know how they did it . however , after they pointed me in the right direction , i was able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by using the seq field ( look in your manual under fields ) . fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect , they have links to things like counters ( chapter number , section , number ) or dates , file names , etc . one of the fields is seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add \" ex / n \" to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex is the name or identifier for the counter , the / n is to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there are many predefined sequences , e . g . { seq chapter } refers to chapter numbers . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which does : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you \\' ve created which has the right margins , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - referencing examples : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number created in ( a ) above ( along with the parentheses ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 characters ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , \" as we saw in example \" ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operations can be simplified with macros . there are many possibilities that i have n\\'t mentioned . for instance , if you want to number the examples in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to is before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on numbering in word 2 came from : numbering examples in dos : you are right , the automatic numbering of examples in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as cross-references to examples in the text . the name of the program is renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by writing to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spaulding ave . ; los angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mailing jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have used renumber in the past , and it works well . it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for super-sophisticated searching , try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of . regarding your \\'s earch \\' question , there is a * lot * of stuff available out there , depending on the scope of your intended use . . . . if you \\' re just going for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i looked .

              " 'subject: sum : metathesis\\n \\n back in may i posted a query on both linguist and an-lang ( austronesian languages and linguistics ) asking for references on treatments of metathesis using recent phonological theory . i was mainly interested in synchronic metathesis of c / v type , which occurs pervasively in dawan ( w . timor ) which i was doing a bit of work on . this is a summary of responses on both lists , which came from : juliette blevins , bob blust , jim fox , beth hume , greg kinkley , john mccarthy , andy pawley , john stonham , mark taber , and aone van engelenhoven . it turns out that metathesis has come to play a fairly important role in recent discussions of morphological and phonological theory . also more and more examples of metathesis as a synchronic phenomenon have been coming to light in various language descriptions . austronesian languages have provoked considerable interest , with rotuman probably the best known ( e . g . besnier 1987 ) , letinese ( van engelenhoven ) and dawan ( steinhauer , tarno et al . ) becoming better known in the literature , and ( chuck and barabara grimes p . c . ) a number of other languages of eastern indonesia exhibiting varieties of metathesis waiting in the wings for examination by theoreticians ( e . g . christensen and christensen 1992 ; coward 1990 ; coward and coward to appear ; marshall 1991 ; steven 1990 ; taber and taber 1992 - references provided by mark taber ) . metathesis is a relatively rare phenomenon in natural language . in a climate where theoreticians are wanting more and more to let universal principles and constraints explain the output of grammars , it appears to contravene constraints that both phonologists and morphologists would like to impose on languages . an important change suggested in autosegmental theory which was designed to accommodate some crucial instances of metathesis without appealing to movement rules , was the segregation of c and v tiers , applied to rotuman in besnier ( 1987 ) . since then moves have been made to make constraints and their interplay the foundation of theory more directly , and the trend seems to be towards abandoning such devices as tier segregation , at least in optimality theory . in optimality theory , one of the constraints suggested is that segments should preserve their linear order ( linearity : mccarthy 1995 ) . obviously overridden in heavily metathesising languages like dawan . in approaches within optimality theory ( mccarthy , hume ) one principle can dominate another principle , and therefore override it . in c / v metathesising languages , under certain conditions a principle demanding ( morpheme - or word - ) final closed syllables dominates others which would achieve contrary effects , allowing metathesis to occur [ apologies for mangling complex arguments in an attempt at one-line summary ] . another problem raised by metathesis in the realm of morphology is noted by stonham ( 1994 : 141 - 2 ) : \" it defies the use of concatenative accounts of morphological effects . . . it has been called upon as a key example of the need for process - based morphology in such works as anderson ( 1983 , 1992 ) , janda ( 1984 ) and zwicky ( 1988 ) \" . stonham argues to the contrary that difficulties encountered by combinatorial morphology in handling metathesis do not show that the theory is inadequate or processes like movement rules are needed : rather the difficulties reflect the fact that metathesis does not occur as a grammatical marker . he reanalyses several instances of apparent grammatical metathesis as resulting from phonological processes . this approach looks promising , at least for dawan , where much of the metathesis looks as if it could be ultimately prosodically motivated , although i can\\'t prove that right now . although blevins ( 1994 ) is more about such things as vowel length than metathesis directly , the approach , which emphasises looking at metathesis not as an isolated phenomenon , but in the context of a full prosodic analysis , is admirable . such analysis would need to take into account discourse conditioning too , as noted by mark taber for luang . references anderson , stephen r .

              " 'subject: sum : a ( formerly ) productive morphological process ?\\n \\n about 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form \\' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon \\' , ` afro - asiatic \\' , and ` dano - norwegian \\' but ` sociopolitical \\' , ` socioeconomic \\' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american \\' by the fuller form ` african american \\' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american \\' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american \\' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black \\' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate ; the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american \\' because she could n\\'t find ` afro \\' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white \\' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american \\' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american \\' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 \\'s . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire \" phenomenon \" can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of \" pristine \" etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i \\' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term \" black \" had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term \" afro - american \" , but he rejected it on the grounds that \" afro \" was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n\\'t want a term that would suggest merely \" americans who wear afro hair-do \\'s \" . \\' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african \\' to ` afro - \\' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american \\' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n\\'t consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american \\' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - \\' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac \\' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian \\' in favour of ` serbian / croatian \\' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - \\' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash \\' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience ;

              " 'subject: judgment fatigue : summary , part i\\n \\n summary of responses to request for information on judgment fatigue ( also called syntactic satiation ) original post : linguist list : vol-6 - 974 . mon jul 17 1995 . issn : 1068-4875 . special thanks to the following respondents : kimberly barskaitiki , tim beasley , elizabeth bergman , michael bernstein , vivian cook , joseph davis , rianne doeleman , karen emmorey , suzette haden elgin , ted harding , stephen helmreich , erika l . konrad , john e . limber , bruce nevin , john robert ross , carson t schutze , linda shockey , william snyder , karin stromswold , joyce tang boyland , anyone i may have missed , and anyone who thought about responding but has n\\'t yet . karin stromswold and william snyder have actually investigated this phenomenon . i have not read either of their papers yet , but i look forward to doing so . william snyder ( snyder @ psyche . mit . edu ) presented a poster on this topic at lsa 1994 , which was mentioned in rick hudson \\'s summary post of july 29 , 1994 . individual \\'s interested in dr . snyder \\'s poster should contact him directly . hudson \\'s post ( linguist list : vol-5 - 855 . fri 29 jul 1994 . issn : 1068-4875 . ) summarized the literature available which addresses the difference between linguists \\' and non-linguists \\' intuitions . hudson also mentions ( but does not cite ) four references provided by joyce tang boyland regarding satiation effects ( both syntactic and semantic ) . hudson \\'s original post is available from linguist list archives . joyce tang boyland \\'s response is included below ( in part ii of post , following ) . karin stromswold \\'s response ( karin @ muddle . rutgers . edu ) was my connection to snyder , hudson , and boyland . her post is most relevant to my original query and is included in its entirety below ( in part ii of post , following ) . most responses mentioned the influence of continual or repeated exposure over a period of time , either mentioning examples similar to perceptual or semantic satiation such as a word-repetition effect . ( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . there are many differences , however , between the effects of semantic satiation and \" syntactic satiation \" or judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item ( see also stromswold \\'s post below ) . judgment fatigue , in contrast , cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence . in fact , published experiments by nagata show that raters \\' intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation . second , the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue . the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it , but that individual \\'s attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence , and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost , not the ability to make sense of the utterance . third , while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established , it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees ( stromswold , snyder as cited in hudson \\'s post ) . this is not the case for semantic satiation , where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect . fourth , the \" scanting out \" effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli , not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality , with no fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items , be they open or closed class items . note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously \" great - - grammatical \" or \" horrible - - ungrammatical \" . there is a definite influence of marginality , an effect which , to date , i believe no one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( as well as perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level . this could not be the ( only ) reason for judgment fatigue , however , because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli ( such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items ) . for this reason , it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological / chemical / neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level . at this point , i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while i am not an expert on semantic satiation , i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon , but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , and one anonymous ) also observed \\' that the longer you stay in linguistics , the less you speak english . \\' to quote from bruce nevin \\'s response : < < a student was once asked , in my hearing , if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english . the reply : \\' i think he used to be . \\' > > hudson \\'s previous summation further confirms that linguists and non-linguists do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences . this type of long-term \" drift \" of linguists \\' judgments may be of interest in its own regard , but this type of \" judgment drift \" is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address . as noted by beasley and konrad , it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages , exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect , or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts ( such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as \" weak crossover \" or \" island constraints \" , for example ) may actually alter an individual \\'s criteria for grammatical acceptability . if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic type-categorizations , then one may expect that an individual \\'s discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual \\'s personal experiences with exemplars of the categories . others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . this is not the case . a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously , such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts , regardless of the concreteness of the topic , with the following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli ( which have not yet been clearly defined , but see part ii of post , following ) and by the listener \\'s / reader \\'s focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence . other individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue . some such sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , may induce confusion , but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions . for ambiguous or confusing stimuli , we say , \" someone should rewrite this sentence . it is ambiguous ( or anomalous ) . \" when we have judgment fatigue , we say , \" i \\' m a monoglot , but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical . i sure do n\\'t feel like a native english speaker ! \" lastly , some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement , and actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank you again to all who responded . if you are interested in the current proposal for my experiments , or if you would like to hear more about the results and conclusions from the experiments when i am finished running them , please contact me . please see part ii ( posted separately ) for selected quotes from respondents .\\n',\n",

\" i quickly understood that he was no more a priest than i was , particularly when i saw him with a beautiful young girl who scarcely knew any walloon but who was determined to learn it from teachers like pierrot , like jannot , like roger , or like me ; that \\'s what he said , the fool . the passage was written by m . georges pasau , pre \\'s ident du muse \\' e de la parole au pays de bastogne ; it appeared in issue 4 ( 1994 ) of the magazine _ singuliers _ , which is devoted to walloon . this was a special number given over to the publication of a new dictionary of walloon . the dictionary is michel francard ( 1994 ) , _ dictionnaire des parlers wallons du pays de bastogne _ , brussels : deboeck / universite \\' , isbn 2-8041 - 1957 - 2 . francard is professor of romance linguistics at the university of louvain in belgium ; his address is faculte \\' des lettres , universite \\' catholique de louvain , louvain - le - nauve , belgium , and his e-mail is francard @ frwa . ucl . ac . be . i have n\\'t consulted him yet , but plan to do so . the orthography used here for walloon was , i believe , invented by francard specifically for the dictionary . the dictionary contains some nice dialect maps and some linguistic information about walloon . my thanks to jean - francois carrasco , richard coates , jean - francois delannoy , roger feron , frederik fouvry , vincent granville , ted harding , yolande meessen , philippe mennecier , bernd moebius ( and his mother ! ) , joseph reisdoerfer , thierry j . van steenberghe , guido vanden wyngaerd , and max wheeler . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk\\n',\n",

fortunately the \\' 501 deal \\' was more common and so it was a lot easier to figure out the meaning of the second sentence . a few people thought the 501 might be a car . this possibility had crossed our minds too . after having looked it up in a car encycopedia and having consulted a local peugeot dealer , indeed a 301 , a 401 , and a 601 , and even a 504 , turned out to exist ; a peugeot 501 , however , just does n o t exist ! so this solution had to be ruled out . the great majority of the respondents told us , that 501 refers to the popular button-fly levi \\'s blue jeans with straight legs . in holland this type of jeans is familiar also , but we did n\\'t understand the \" major used - 501 deal \" in this context : \" what \\'s the big deal in selling worn blue jeans ? \" however , most respondents from the u . s . , but also from european countries , told us , that it is very popular to buy and sell used 501 \\'s in the us . apparently young people are willing to pay much money for used jeans , because they are more comfortable ( less stiff ) and because they look more \\' hip \\' than the new ones . many companies buy used 501 \\'s and after that they are sold from stores ( e . g . , on melrose ave . in l . a . there are at least half a dozen of these stores ) . besides that , there \\'s a huge ( black ) market , in which case people sell 501 \\'s out of the back of cars or vans in parking lots or other public places . there might also be a foreign market for used 501 \\'s , as rumour has it that used 501 \\'s are also shipped off to paris , london , the far east ( japan ) and eastern europe . because so many people reacted , we cannot quote them all . so we have made a selection . as some of the respondents preferred not to be mentioned by name , we decided to not mention anyone by name . at the end of this recital we will give a short conclusion . . 501 \\'s , what \\'s it all about \" 501 \\'s are a style of blue jeans made by levi strauss and co . 501 \\'s are , i believe , the best-selling style of levi \\'s . they are button-fly ( as opposed to the kind you zip up ) , and have 5 pockets . they are the kind of jeans people think of when they think of jeans . here in the us , used 501 \\'s are worth more than other kinds of used jeans - - in college towns , you \\' ll often see signs in vintage clothing stores specifically saying something like \" cash for used 501 \\'s . \" before perestroika , there was a big black market demand in russia for jeans of any kind . levi \\'s were the prestige brand ; i do n\\'t know the location in time and space of your narrative , but perhaps the deal is shady . a major deal involving used jeans ( which here can be bought new on sale for $ 20 , and used , might fetch the original owner $ 10 in a vintage store ) must then be a negotiation about a truck full of jeans or so . many pairs would be needed to make the cash involved a major deal . \" . used - 501 sale vs . used - 501 deal \" used 501 \\'s are becoming in recent years more and more popular among the youth of this country , hence the rise in shops and vendors that deal exclusively in these used products . _ a used - 501 deal _ is most likely an informal street sale ( not through a well-established shop , in which case it would be called a _ sale _ ) of used jeans , especially levi brand jeans \\' \" . witnessing a 501 deal \" so the sentence could mean either the speaker witnessed someone purchase used ( previously owned ) 501 \\'s , with \\'d eal \\' meaning \\' ( business ) transaction \\' , or \\'d eal \\' could mean \\' bargain \\' , that the jeans were being sold for less than usual . the fact that the speaker uses the verb \\' witness \\' would seem to remove him from the action , so perhaps the first interpretation is best . \" . cowboys like their 501 \\'s blue and stiff \" i recently read an article about a company who buys used blue jeans from real cowboys and sells them at a very high price to people in places like new york city . ( cowboys , of which my brother-in - law is one , do n\\'t wear their jeans when they start to fade , they like them blue and stiff . ) \" . a used - 501 deal \" i \\' m inspired to write by a sign i saw a few minutes ago , while driving home from the office . it announced that a merchant would pay up to $ 17us for \" used 501s . \" \" 501 \" refers to a style of blue jeans - what my grandmother used to call dungarees - manufactured by the levi strauss co . all their style numbers are numbers between 500 and 600 . 501 is a popular style among young persons , featuring a button-fly and straight legs . i \\' m no longer young enough for 501s ; i must wear 512s , which have a fuller leg and seat . tomorrow , i \\' m going to take all my old , unwearable 501s and trade them for $ 17us each . i \\'d say that a \" major used - 501 deal \" is either a transaction such as the one i \\' m proposing for tomorrow or , because \" deal \" is sometimes used more generically , somewhat like \" thing \" , a place of business where such transactions take place . \" . major 501 price , major 501 place or major 501 transaction \" \" a major used - 501 deal \" no doubt refers to one of those temporary locations where people offer to buy used levi 501 jeans for around $ 8 , with the intention of re-selling them elsewhere . \" deal \" is so inarticulate a word that it \\'s not possible to tell you definitively what is meant , apart from more context . ( 1 ) my best guess is that it relates to \" getting a good deal \" for your used 501 jeans , that is , getting a good price for them . the scenario i have constructed is that someone wants to point out a place where you can get good money by selling your used 501 jeans . ( 2 ) if it does n\\'t have to do with getting a price for used jeans , it might refer to the physical characteristics of the business place itself . this particular temporary storefront may be larger or more conspicuous than usual . in that scenario , someone wants to point out a larger-than - usual 501 jeans stand . ( \" a major used - 501 whatchamacallit : stand , storefront , business \" ) ( 3 ) last scenario : someone witnessed a major jeans-selling transaction . he wants to describe someone \\'s having brought in and sold a large quantity of 501 jeans to the jeans buyer . to be brief here are three possible paraphrases for \" a major used - 501 deal \" . 1 . \" a place where they give you a much better-than - average price for your used 501 jeans \" 2 . \" a large or impressive used - 501 jeans stand \" 3 . \" a single business transaction involving the buying and selling of a large lot of 501 jeans \" \" . conclusion in reference to the last respondent , somehow we felt most comfortable with the third paraphrase , mainly because according to most of the other respondents a business t r a n s a c t i o n was involved here and because according to our own intuition \\' to witness \\' - - at least when it means \\' to see sth . \\' - - always goes with an object , expressing an a c t i o n rather than a s t a t e . in the case of the \\' 501 deal \\' this means that the one who uttered the sentence , s a w that a 501 actually w a s b e i n g sold and because he speaks of a major deal , he saw a lot of 501s being sold at once . so , in our opinion : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a major used - 501 deal . \" can best be paraphrased into : \" one day , in the parking lot of the concert hall , i witnessed a business transaction involving a large stock of used levi \\'s 501 . \" if someone still feels uncomfortable with this transcription , please do n\\'t hesitate to send your reaction to wimk @ zeus . cs . kun . nl . thanks again for all your contributions . many regards , wim koole , also on behalf of janny koole - loonstra nijmegen holland\\n',\n",

( btw , what are some of the etymologies given for \" girl \" , \" boy \" , \" marry \" ? ) alexis says : thank you for responding . since we obviously agree about the final resolution of this issue , i guess i would say that there are simply two aspects to the way one must respond to the people who are claiming that the generic he was invented by male chauvinist grammarians . one is yours ( that it has a continuous history within english ) [ did i say that ? - jw ] . the other is mine ( that if we knew nothing about the history of english , the universal picture would authorize us to suppose that this was indeed a natural phenomenon , not an invention of the grammarians ) . but i would then say that the presumed reason why this phenomenon is universal is presumably that all known cultures ( or maybe there is one exception , according to what i read somewhere ) have been male-dominated at all known time periods , and the fact that masculine / male is \\' unmarked \\' must surely be a reflection of this . so , the locus of the blame [ ! ] shifts from the conscious work of english grammarians to the subconscious workings of the language faculties of countless generations of human beings all over the planet who have lived in societies where there was no concept of sex equality . what do you think ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jeff responds thanks for the elaboration . what do i think ? first , to get it straight . . . you are saying that comparable structures to \" generic he \" are found in all languages ( with perhaps a few exceptions ) , and on that basis a person might be led to conclude it is a natural phenomenon , but they would be wrong . rather , universal male domination is the explanation , as seen in the unmarked pronoun \" he \" , and we must \" blame \" the subconscious workings of the language faculties of all people in history , who have had no concept of sex equality . i have three questions , each of which i provide some of my own views about . 1 ) what are some of the parameters of and who ( authors ) do you look to for your idea that all history has been male dominated ? ( i personally resent this characterization . ) \" dominated \" hinges on what you mean - - the crimson sunset dominated the horizon and the pimples dominated the young girl \\'s face . on a group level , men , qua males , have been sufficiently dutiful to \" women and children first \" that they can be said to have historically regarded their own lot as the more expendable , i . e . , at least as might say the contour of a bell-curve measuring such a thing . men subdue the metaphorical colin fergusons of the world , not women . on an individual level , camille paglia nails it when she talks about the substantial power of women over men , qua males , based on women \\'s power to close their legs . 2 ) where does your concept of linguistic markedness come from , and on what basis do you establish a cause-effect relationship between patriarchy and markedness in pronouns ? my own idea of markedness is based on the original exposition as seen formulated by jakobson and trubetzkoy about 1930 ( see _ on language _ , roman jakobson , ed . linda r . waugh , 1990 . chapter 8 ) . a conclusion opposite to yours ( and gender feminists ) seems evident from the original formulation . their concept of \" the mark \" grew out of interest in binary aspects of language , like past / present , long / short . trubetzkoy wrote , \" only one of the terms of a correlation is perceived as actively modified and as positively possessing some mark , while the other term is perceived as lacking the mark and as passively unmodified \" ( p136 ) . this suggests to me that \" woman \" and \" she \" are \" species \" terms which females \" have \" as an exclusive and special privilege , whereas males do not have a \" species \" name exclusively their own , but instead must suffer to share a \" genus \" designation . it is for this reason i prefer sometimes to call the masculine unmarked words \" tautonyms \" ( i . e . , in biology , one name for both species and genus ) . the editor of the book goes on to comment on the concept : \" thus , the general meaning of _ lion _ , in contradistinction to that of _ lioness _ , implies no sexual specification - - and only the * basic meaning * of _ lion _ prompted by informative contexts suggests a sexual specification : e . g . , _ lions and lionesses _ \" . is n\\'t this saying that man qua male emerges only in contexts that contrast him with the female ? otherwise , he is a generic ( genus , genre ) person and accordingly unmarked - - i . e . , \" just \" a person . the jakobson book continues , \" the constraining , focusing character of the marked term of any grammatical opposition is directed toward a more narrowly specified and delimited conceptual item \" . if men wanted to throw a testy beef about it , they could say , \" how come the gals have exclusive words , but the guys have to share theirs with everybody else ? \" 3 ) finally , you propose that in all past history they \\' ve had \" no concept of sex equality \" . there is an inherent chronocentrism ( my term ) in your indictment , but , notwithstanding , i \\' m somewhat sure you \\' re talking about \" rights \" . \" rights \" , equal or otherwise , is a modern concept that is often muddled and sometimes useless if one considers , as i do , that the more important ends of life are happiness , inner peace , and freedom from fear - - what good are abstract rights if one is miserable all the time ? . the extremely important distinction is too often lost sight of between concepts of inherent rights and entitlement rights . if we discuss \" women \\'s equality \" and \" men \\'s equality \" without talking about documents like the universal declaration of human rights , the united states constitution , the code of hammurabi , etc . , or sources of rights , like god or the barrel of a gun , we are not going to get anywhere . if we take into account considerations of class , age , history , geography , etc . , i would argue that on a de facto level , women have had , and continue to have , collectively , an advantage over men . i know that saying so will upset a few of us , even give some of us a little gas and heartburn , my being the direct precipitation of which i apologize for in advance . best regards , jeffrey\\n',\n",

\" is a european union funded project ( copernicus \\' 93 project no . 10393 ) whose aim is to embed spoken natural language synthesis technology with sophisticated user interfaces in order to improve access to information systems . multimedia technology and knowledge-based text processing enhance the development of new types of information systems which not only offer references or full-text documents to the user but also provide access to images , graphics , audio and video documents . this diversification of the in formation offered has to be supported by easy-to - use multimodal user interfaces , which are capable of presenting each type of information item in a way that it can be perceived and processed effectively by the user . users can easily process simultaneously the graphical medium of information presentation and the linguistic medium . the separation of mode is also quite appropriate for the different functionalities of the main graphical interaction and the supportive meta-dialogue carried out linguistically . we believe , therefore , that a substantial improvement in both functionality and user acceptance is to be achieved by the integration of spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech that sounds unnatural and that is hard to listen to . high quality synthesized speech that sounds acceptable to humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . the effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings , rather than word sequences , and requires understanding of the functions of intonation . in the domain of sophisticated human-machine interfaces , we can make use of the increasing tendency to design such interfaces as independent agents that themselves engage in an interactive dialogue ( both graphical and linguistic ) with their users . such agents need to maintain models of their discourses , their users , and their communicative goals . the speak ! project , which was launched recently as a cooperation between the speech research technology laboratory of the technical university of budapest and the technical university of darmstadt ( in cooperation with gmd-ipsi ) , aims at developing such an interface for a multimedia retrieval system . at ipsi , the departments komet ( natural language generation ) and mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute to this project . the project is to construct a proof-of - concept prototype of a multimodal information system combining graphical and spoken language output in a variety of languages . the work involves four supporting goals : first , to advance the state of the art in the domains of speech synthesis , spoken text generation , and graphical interface design ; second , to provide enabling technology for higher functionality information systems that are more appropriate for general public use ; third , to significantly improve the public and industrial acceptance of speech synthesis in general and the hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within the project in particular ; and , fourth , to act as a focusing point for speech work in hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g \\' eza n \\' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401\\n',\n",

i do believe that many traditions ( sexism being one of them ) and perspectives are partially conveyed through language . however , like you , i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together . i do believe that historically today \\'s sexist interactive patterns are influenced - - among other factors - - by sociolinguistic practices during biblical times when a wife had to address her husband as slaves had to address their master , or subjects their king . this implied that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject , i . e . , using a clear rhetoric of authority . today , conversational dominance by males in our judeo-christian society is not as extreme as during the biblical times , but interestingly it is still inherent to male-specific discourse and has become the focus of some interesting sociolinguistic research . as a matter of fact , i moved to the bible belt one year ago ( i spent 10 years on the east and west coasts in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year ; originally i come from europe ) , and after observations of interractive patterns among couples around me , i came to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious ( or traditional ) impact on people \\'s life , the more sex discrimination is reflected in language use . i have also noticed much more instances of sex discrimination in language use in offices i had to go to in the bible belt ( e . g . doctor and lawyer offices , insurance agencies , etc . ) than in other professional offices i visited elsewhere in the u . s . i found this extremely interesting . > ( a ) i do believe that people in all kinds of cultures themselves > believe that men and male behavior are superior in some sense to > women and female behavior , and i hold that this perception ( even if > it were not accurate ) is what must matter to us as we discuss > sexist language . whether the perception is accurate is of no importance > in this context . why should it be of no importance ? shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it is ? what is the point of studying linguistics if it is for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis ? shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implications revealed by research , or could we also use research findings to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously ( socially ) acquired schemata ? studies in psychology have shown that females reading texts written in a generic \" he \" retain less information than when they read texts using a generic plural . obviously , the impact of using a sexist language goes beyond the simple interest of linguistic studies within a certain context . personally , i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large . what is the point of considering discriminatory perspectives as unchangeable or questionable facts whereas we all know that both languages and human psychology have the potential to change ?

              " \"subject: phonemicity of writing\\n \\n i would like to get some estimate of what percentage of the world 's written languages are represented orthographically in a phonemic manner . more specifically , how many written languages are such that one can predict the phonological properties of a word - - - including stress , accent or tone - - - merely by consulting the string of symbols used to write that word , and without further information , such as the morphological structure of the word ? for a language whose writing system is largely phonemic , one could write down a set of rules for word pronunciation , and in the ideal case the number of rules would be within an order of magnitude of the number of graphemes . ( a few lexical exceptions do n't matter , as long as there are n't hundreds of them . ) i am leaving the sense of ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally a phonemic written representation implies that one can predict the surface phonemic representation from the written form of the word , but i would be perfectly happy considering a system to be phonemic if some more abstract level of phonological representation were represented , from which the surface phonemic representation could be predicted by regular phonological rules / principles . ( i should also note , to clarify the question further , that i am interested primarily in the correspondence between the written form and the spoken form for the the standard variet ( y , ies ) of the language , which the written form presumably reflects to some degree : i am not interested ( at the moment ) in dialects of the language which deviate to varying degrees from the standard . ) so , under this definition , spanish would presumably count as very phonemic since one can nearly always predict the pronunciation of a word , including its stress , from the orthography . romanian is less phonemic since while the actual set of phonemes in a word is mostly determinable by the set of graphemes used ( with the representation of glides being slight source of complication ) , the placement of stress requires some knowledge of the morphological class of the word ( following work of ioana chitoran ) . english is presumably among the least phonemic , since the ` regular rules ' of pronunciation are themselves quite complex , and there are many lexical exceptions . the particular classification of the writing system as logographic , moraic or segmental is unimportant : in principle chinese writing could be classed as phonemic ( albeit with a rather large set of graphemes ) , but for the fact that especially among the more common characters there are quite a few with pronunciation ambiguities which can only be resolved using lexical information . i am familiar with several of the recent books on writing systems : but while these typically contain in-depth analyses of particular systems , as far as i can tell , nobody has done a survey of this kind . ( if on the contrary , someone can point me to a survey that answers this question , i would be most grateful . ) so , i would be very interested in getting as much information related to this question on as many languages as people are sufficiently familiar with . i think i already know the answer to these questions for the more familiar western european languages ( including some less familiar ones like irish and welsh ) , as well as romanian , russian , hebrew , arabic , chinese , japanese and malagasy . i would be particularly interested in knowing about languages for which writing systems have only recently been developed , or for which the spelling system has recently undergone a massive restructuring : conventional wisdom has it that in such cases the writing system should be very phonemic , but perhaps that is not always true . please send any replies to me , and if there are a sufficient number i will post the results of this survey to the list . - richard sproat linguistics research department at&t bell laboratories | tel ( 908 ) 582-5296 600 mountain avenue , room 2d - 451 | fax ( 908 ) 582-7308 murray hill , nj 07974 , usa | rws @ research . att . com\\n\",\n",

it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation \" on the ground . \" in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations \" on the ground \" to get read as a single mtdna \" migration \" is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the \" genetic mutation \" occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many \" real \" migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less \" subgroups of amerind . \" we may wish it did , but it does n\\'t . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists \\' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife \\'s actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term \" migration \" . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg \\'s notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy \\'s description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )\\n',\n",
              " 'subject: genetic classification\\n \\n i wish to make some comments on an issue that recent discussion of nostratic and the problem of \" demonstrating \" distant genetic relationships has skirted around that i believe underlies some of the issues that various people have been directly addressing . an assumption that seems to underly much of the discussion is that hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are not interesting unless they can be proven to be true . i find this a rather odd assumption , and one that does not seem to be made about any other kinds of hypotheses in linguistics ( or anywhere else in science as far as i know ) . and let us set aside for the sake of argument the oft-noted point that the notion of proof is not really applicable to empirical hypotheses , and assume that the term is to be used loosely for some arbitrary high level of certainty . it seems fair to say that there is a fairly widespread disinterest in hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis because it is widely believed ( and i will assume it is true here for the sake of argument ) that the available evidence for nostratic falls short of this imaginary level of certainty which deserves the label \" proven \" . a common type of reaction to unproven hypotheses is that it has not been demonstrated that the observed similarities might not be due to chance and / or borrowing . but suppose that someone were to take the same attitude towards comparative reconstruction of protolanguages . suppose that someone were to object to comparative reconstruction of anything but very shallow groups on the grounds that one can never prove that the reconstructions are correct . just as one can object to certain claims of genetic relationships on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility that the observed similarities might be due to accident and / or borrowing , one could equally well object to virtually all hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction on the grounds that one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . the comparative method is a way to come up with the best guess one can make about a protolanguage ; it never provides proof that the reconstruction is in fact correct . so why bother doing it ? the answer should be obvious : hypotheses which represent our best guesses at any point in time are what much of science is about . by why do so many linguists seem to object to applying the same way of thinking to hypotheses about genetic relationships ? why is it that many historical linguists find the hypotheses like the nostratic hypothesis either laughable or upsetting ? why do n\\'t they react the same way to comparative reconstructions , since they also are \" unproven \" ? why do n\\'t they rush out and read everything they can find on nostratic and conclude \" the evidence is tantalizing but not conclusive ; it \\'s a really exciting hypothesis \" ? why is there such a double standard ? i want to suggest an answer to this question , an answer which , if right , provides insight into the nature of many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses of genetic relationship . namely , some people find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart from any detailed historical work that plays a role in supporting hypotheses . other people , however , are primarily interested in the detailed historical work itself , and do not find questions of genetic classification intrinsically interesting , but only interesting in so far as they are an inevitable consequence of historical work . people of the first sort are more likely to find recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while people of the latter sort are unlikely to react that way , unless they are penutian specialists . as one moves back in time , the ability to apply the comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , and detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( and to many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . but at any time depth , we can always be much more confident of the genetic classification than we can of any comparative reconstructions . our confidence in indo - european as a language family is surely greater than our confidence in any specific claims about proto - indo - european . but as we move further back in time , we should expect there to be hypotheses that we cannot be entirely confident of , but for which there is at least some promising evidence , where any comparative reconstruction is going to be sufficiently speculative as to not be satisfying to linguists interested in traditional comparative work . and since these linguists are not interested in genetic classification except as a biproduct of detailed historical work , such linguists are likely to find the hypotheses uninteresting . on the other hand , for linguists who find questions of genetic classification inherently interesting , the fact that detailed historical work may not be possible is irrelevant , and the fact that the hypothesis is unproven or unprovable may be no more a source of concern than the fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven and unprovable . if this view is correct , much of the debate surrounding controversial hypotheses in genetic classification is based , not on substantive questions , but simply on what sorts of questions different people find interesting . matthew dryer\\n',\n",

              " \"subject: the ldc united nations corpus\\n \\n in linguist 6 . 973 and a parallel query to the corpora list , rapahel salkie asked some questions about the un parallel corpus from the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) . before these queries appeared , a response to an earlier query from dr . salkie had already gone out privately from rebecca finch . i certainly urge anyone with experience in using the un corpus to respond to dr . salkie as well . we have also placed a sample of 24 ( out of 21 , 000 ) parallel documents , each in english , french and spanish , in : ftp : / / ftp . cis . upenn . edu / pub / ldc / data _ samples / un _ par _ sample . tar . z these samples should also be accessible , along with quite a bit of other ldc information , from the www page at url http : / / www . cis . upenn . edu / ~ ldc let me add a few words about ldc prices and costs , since dr . salkie 's message expressed the normal human annoyance at being asked to part with money , both in the case of the un corpus and another ( not yet published ) ldc parallel text corpus , the canadian hansard . the ldc membership fee for a university is $ 2 , 000 , and for this fee everyone at that university can get an unlimited and perpetual research license for everything that the ldc publishes during the year of membership . thus you can join the other ninety current members of the corsortium and get not only the forthcoming hansard corpus , but also the other twenty or so databases published this year . for the same amount , a university can get the un corpus and the other 15 databases published in 1994 . whether a particular database , or collection of databases , is worth that amount of money is of course a matter of individual or institutional judgement . we feel that $ 2 , 000 , which is roughly the cost of a moderately configured pc or an international conference trip , is not out of line even for university researchers . speaking for myself , i have a great deal of sympathy for the effort to provide research resources free or at minimal cost , and i have been involved in several successful efforts to bring out such databases over the years , including the acl / dci cd-rom , the eci disk , the celex disk , and others offered in the range of $ 25 - $ 200 . these efforts rely heavily on volunteer labor and other donated resources ; in several cases they have also relied on cash donations from the ldc . however , volunteer labor is rarely available in the needed quantities ; and of course ldc - supplied cash , as well as the existence of the ldc as an organization , depends on income from somewhere . the money that we get from memberships and database sales is a crucial part of the picture - - - without it the ldc would not exist , and neither would either of the databases under discussion . to highlight the point , the history of the u . n . publication is worth reviewing briefly . we decided to try to publish the u . n . archives because translation researchers wanted parallel texts . after concluding several months of negotiations with un representatives and lawyers for both sides , we paid for a nj - based computer consultant to go into the un offices at night so as to make backups of the archives from dismountable disk packs for a long-obsolete wang word processor onto cartridge tapes . this required several months and cost a considerable sum ; we had to use this particular person because he was an authorized service rep for the un facility . then came six person-months of work at the ldc . we had to decode the proprietary and undocumented wang backup format , and the equally proprietary and undocumented wang character set , typographical codes and file structures . we re-organized the entire archive and translated it into wordperfect format , and published a certain number of cd-rom s in this form for the purposes of the un - - - this was part of the agreement that we made with them for access to the data . then we translated the documents into iso-8859 - 1 with sgml markup ( including a working dtd , for those how care ) , and worked out the correspondences among documents . this was far from trivial , since each un language had been entered separately , with no coordination of file names , file dates , or even division of documents into files , and there were tens of thousands of documents per language . this work was mainly done by dave graff , whose salary the ldc pays . we are not likely to recover the costs of acquisition and production of this database through sales and memberships bought for its sake . we subsidize our members by cost-sharing with government grants , or by using income from more popular or less expensive databases to cover unrecovered costs of less popular or more expensive ones . in the case of the forthcoming hansard corpus , which dr . salkie also mentioned , the cost of acquisition and publication has been similar to that of the u . n . material , and the same remarks about subsidies apply . whether a particular database is worth a certain price is a matter of individual taste , but as a matter of simple arithmetic , the fees charged in these two cases are unlikely ever to cover the costs incurred . for those who have read this far , i would like to repeat a standing offer that has been in existence since the beginning of the ldc . if you are interested in cd-rom publication of a language-related database that is plausibly of interest to our membership , and this database is reasonably close to being in shape to publish , we will pay the costs of production , using your label design or one worked out with you ; we will give you up to a hundred copies to do with as you see fit ; we will put the item in our catalogue at whatever price you choose ; and we will remit to you any resulting income in excess of our production costs . the copyright ( if any ) will remain with you , and we will handle any user license arrangements that may be necessary , sending the signed licenses to you . we have published several databases on this basis , and are planning to publish several others , although ( from past experience ) the chances of making back our production costs are no better than even . best wishes , mark liberman myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu 619 williams hall university of pennsylvania phone : 215-898 - 0141 philadelphia , pa 19104-6305 fax : 215-573 - 2175\\n\",\n",
